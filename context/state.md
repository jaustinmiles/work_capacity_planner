- [ ] Remove remaining skipped tests (LogViewer.test.tsx)
- [ ] Review and update all import paths for consistency

#### Documentation
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all decorator functions
- [ ] Create developer guide for adding new decorators
- [ ] Document pattern detection and suppression features

#### Performance
- [ ] Benchmark decorator overhead
- [ ] Optimize transport write performance
- [ ] Add batching for high-frequency logs

#### Features
- [ ] Implement log persistence to database
- [ ] Add log filtering UI in dev tools
- [ ] Create pattern detection dashboard
- [ ] Add remote logging transport option

## Notes
- Using Stage 3 decorators (no experimentalDecorators in tsconfig)
- All UI components should use logger.ui, not logger.system
- Main process uses logger.system or scoped loggers
- Decorators compile and work correctly in database.ts
