### Previous PR: fix/quality-of-life-improvements (PR #20 - Merged)

### Branch: fix/quality-of-life-improvements (PR #20)

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Workflow Step Priority Field Persistence (Critical)

- Added `cognitiveComplexity` to allowedFields in database updateTask
- Field was being filtered out during updates, now properly saved

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Personal Time Not Showing in Sidebar (High)
- WorkStatusWidget now always displays personal time row
- Removed conditional rendering that hid row when value was 0
- Shows 0m when no personal time is logged

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Eisenhower Matrix Duplicate Keys (Medium)
- Deduplicated tasks by filtering out regular tasks that exist as sequenced tasks
- Prevents React key warnings in console
- Ensures each task appears only once in the matrix

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Two Edit Buttons Required (High)
- Added `startInEditMode` prop to TaskEdit component
- TaskItem now passes startInEditMode=true when opening edit modal
- Users go directly to edit mode with single button click

#### ‚úÖ Fixed FeedbackForm Default Priority Not Saving
- Issue: Radio button showed 'medium' selected but form validation failed
- Solution: Added useEffect to set initial form values on mount
- Priority now properly defaults to 'medium' and saves correctly

#### ‚úÖ Added Workflow Deadline Setting UI
- Added DatePicker field to SequencedTaskEdit component
- Deadline now displays in view mode as a red tag

- Added to WorkBlocksEditor dropdown menu
- Addresses user need for "just fill the time" scheduling

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Flexible Block Capacity Calculation
- Corrected double-counting issue (was showing 345+345 instead of 345 total)
- Fixed fractional minutes display with proper rounding
- Special handling for combined capacity in utilization tracking
- Debug info now shows single total for flexible blocks

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Scheduler to Ignore Past Time
- Blocks that have already started now only consider remaining time
- Prevents scheduling in time that has already passed
- Adjusts block start time to current time when appropriate
- Only applies to real-time scheduling, not test scenarios

## Session Completed (2025-08-19 - Scheduler Optimization)

### Critical Scheduler Optimization and Bug Fixes
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Duplicate Workflow Scheduling**
  - Issue: Workflows appearing in both tasks and sequencedTasks arrays were scheduled twice
  - Impact: Double capacity consumption, Peter Tuesday task not being scheduled
  - Solution: Added deduplication logic to remove workflows from tasks array if in sequencedTasks
  - Result: All high-priority tasks now schedule correctly

- ‚úÖ **Fixed Scheduling Gap Regression**
  - Issue: Tasks scheduled at block start (8 AM) when current time was later (9 PM)
  - Root cause: Backfilling logic not respecting actual current time for today's blocks
  - Solution: Pass actual 'now' time to canFitInBlock and use for today's block calculations
  - Result: Tasks now schedule immediately from current time, no large gaps

- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Test Suite Added**
  - Created 27 new tests covering all scheduler functionality
  - Coverage: 56.64% statements, 65.82% branches, 100% functions
  - Tests cover: deduplication, backfilling, task type matching, priority ordering, capacity management
  - Created PR #7 with full documentation

### Major Scheduling Algorithm Fix
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Critical Scheduler Bugs**
  - **Wrong task type placement**: Focus tasks were being scheduled in admin blocks
    - Root cause: Test was using wrong field name (`taskType` instead of `type`)
    - Fixed test data structure to match Task interface
  - **No backfilling**: Scheduler only looked forward from current time
    - Root cause: `canFitInBlock` used `Math.max(currentTime, blockStart)`
    - Fixed by always trying from block start for true backfilling
  - **Result**: Went from 25% to 68.8% capacity utilization (theoretical max without splitting)
  - All 6 test tasks now schedule correctly (100% completion rate)

### Critical Scheduling Debug Fix
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Date Tracking Bug in Scheduling Debug Info**
  - Root cause: `dateStr` variable not updating when scheduler moves to next day
  - Fixed by changing `dateStr` from const to let and updating it when `currentDate` changes
  - This was causing blocks to show as empty even when items were scheduled
  - Created PR #6 on branch `fix/scheduling-debug-date-tracking`
  - User identified this as related to previous timestamp issues

### Bug Fixes and Improvements (Earlier Today)
- ‚úÖ **Task Form Issues Fixed**
  - Fixed deadline input failing due to improper date conversion
  - Fixed priority sliders defaulting to 25 (added defaultValue prop)
  - Improved date validation with proper dayjs usage

- ‚úÖ **Workflow Edit Simplified**
  - Added startInEditMode prop to SequencedTaskEdit component
  - Eliminated double-click requirement for editing workflows
  - Modal now opens directly in edit mode

- ‚úÖ **Scheduling Debug Info Enhanced**
  - Added personal minutes tracking to SchedulingDebugInfo interface
  - Improved empty block detection and reporting
  - Added "Empty block" messages for completely unused time slots
  - Updated UI component to display personal capacity column
  - Fixed critical date tracking issue causing incorrect empty block reporting

- ‚úÖ **Test Suite Fixes**
  - Updated SessionState tests for 12-hour workday parameters
  - Fixed generateArcPath test cases to use workday hours (8am-8pm)
  - Fixed angleToMinutes test expectations for workday constraints

### Process Issues & Learnings
- **CRITICAL MISTAKE**: Attempted to push directly to main branch
- User corrected this breach of professional development practices
- Proper workflow: Create feature branch ‚Üí Push to origin ‚Üí Create PR ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge
- Never push directly to main, even for critical fixes
- Always create new branches for new work, don't reuse old feature branches

### Pending Work (User Requested)
- Find and remove dead code
- Identify refactoring opportunities
- Increase test coverage by 10%

- User emphasized good software engineering practices throughout
- Focused on completing the user story for drag-and-drop work session logging
- Fixed issues systematically with extensive logging for debugging

- Added request to look for dead code and refactoring opportunities

### Key Decisions Made
- Use lane object properties (taskId, stepId) directly instead of parsing IDs
- Keep individual collapsed workflow sessions with isCollapsed flag instead of merging
- Replace deprecated React components for React 19 compatibility
- Maintain focus on feature completion and CI readiness
- Enhance debug info to better track empty time blocks
