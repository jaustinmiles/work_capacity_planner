# Current State

## Latest Status (2025-09-02, Late Evening Session - Continued)

### 🚀 Current Session: Dependency Fix & Documentation Updates (Branch: fix/amendments-and-periodic-events)

#### Completed Improvements (2025-09-02, Evening) ✅

1. **Fixed Duplicate Workflow Bug** ✅
   - Issue: When editing workflows from AI Brainstorm modal, duplicates were created instead of updating
   - Solution: Added `addOrUpdateSequencedTask` method that checks for existing workflows by name
   - Test: Created comprehensive test to prevent regression
   
2. **Bidirectional Dependency Wiring** ✅
   - Extended `DependencyChange` amendment type with `addDependents` and `removeDependents` fields
   - Updated amendment applicator to handle reverse dependencies
   - Created shared `DependencyEditor` component for consistent UI across all editors
   - Enhanced `SequencedTaskEdit` with full bidirectional dependency management
   - Updated `VoiceAmendmentModal` to support editing both directions
   - All tests passing (449 passed, 46 skipped)

3. **PR Review Feedback Addressed** ✅
   - Created unified `dependency-utils.ts` with shared dependency logic
   - Extended `DependencyEditor` to support both direct and amendment modes
   - Removed duplicate `DependencyChangeEdit` component
   - Increased test coverage from 23.51% to 24.57%
   - Added 31 new tests for dependency utilities and editor

4. **Enhanced Logging System** ✅
   - Added comprehensive logging to `DependencyEditor` for debugging UI issues
   - Implemented pattern-based log filtering in `LogViewer`:
     - Automatically groups similar errors by pattern
     - Hide/show error patterns with single click
     - Shows count of hidden logs per pattern
     - Helps reduce log spam from repetitive errors
   - Enhanced amendment applicator with detailed logging

5. **Fixed Dependency Removal Issue** ✅
   - **Problem**: Could not remove dependencies in workflow step edit modal
   - **Root Cause**: DependencyEditor was reading stale form values via `getFieldValue()`
   - **Solution**: Use local state for current values, pass to DependencyEditor
   - **Result**: Unidirectional data flow - state → component → onChange → state
   - User confirmed fix is working!

6. **Documentation Updates** ✅
   - Added PR Review Protocol to CLAUDE.md with all 18 best practices
   - Updated context/best-practices.md with review response protocol
   - Documented lessons learned about checking GitHub comments

**Addressed 2 bugs and 1 feature from feedback.json:**

1. **Bug Fix: Sequenced Task Creation Failure** ✅
   - Issue: Duplicate ID constraint violation when creating sequenced tasks
   - Root Cause: Steps were reusing IDs from existing tasks
   - Fix: Always generate new UUIDs for task steps in database.ts

2. **Bug Fix: Dependency Wiring Not Working** ✅
   - Issue: Dependencies showed "step-0" instead of actual step names
   - Root Cause: When creating tasks, temporary IDs (step-0, step-1) weren't mapped to new UUIDs
   - Fix: Created ID mapping system to update dependencies when steps get new IDs
   - Also fixed updateTask to handle dependency mapping correctly

3. **Feature: Task Type Filter** ✅
   - Added filter dropdown to TaskList component
   - Users can filter by: All Tasks, Work Items (Focused + Admin), Focused, Admin, or Personal
   - Shows count of filtered vs total tasks

### 📚 Lessons Learned

#### PR Review Process Failure (2025-09-02)
**Issue**: Failed to check actual GitHub PR comments before implementing fixes
**Impact**: Implemented wrong solution, created circular dependency pattern
**Root Cause**: No clear instruction to check PR comments directly
**Fix**: Added PR Review Protocol to CLAUDE.md and best-practices.md
**Prevention**: Always use `gh pr view` to check comments before starting work

**Specific Failure**:
- User pointed out circular onChange pattern in DependencyEditor
- Comment: "this almost feels circular... handleDependenciesChange is calling onChange(), but onChange() is defined to call handleDependencies"
- I didn't read this comment and instead made superficial fixes
- Result: Wasted time on wrong solution, user frustration
