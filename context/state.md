### ðŸš€ Current Session: Complete Schedule Generation Redesign

#### Major Architecture Change: Optimal Scheduler
1. **Created New Optimal Scheduler** ðŸ”„
   - Built mathematical optimization-based scheduler in `optimal-scheduler.ts`
   - Removes artificial work hour constraints (9-5 limits)
   - Generates work blocks based on task needs, not predefined patterns
   - Optimizes for earliest possible completion time
   - Respects only hard constraints: sleep (11pm-7am) and meetings
   - Smart handling of async work, dependencies, and breaks

2. **Integration with ScheduleGenerator** âœ…
   - "Optimal (Fastest Completion)" option now uses new optimizer
   - "Balanced" and "Async-Optimized" still use old scheduler for work-life balance
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing components

3. **Key Design Decisions** 
   - Did NOT modify flexible-scheduler.ts (used by WeeklyCalendar, GanttChart)
   - Created separate optimal-scheduler to avoid breaking existing manual scheduling
   - Tests still failing - need update to match new paradigm

#### Previous Fixes in This Session
1. **Clarification Regeneration UI Refresh** âœ…
   - Fixed UI not updating after "Regenerate with Clarification"
   - Improved React state management
   
2. **Schedule Generation Critical Issues** âœ…
   - Fixed scheduler ignoring work block time boundaries
   - Was scheduling outside defined hours (e.g., 8pm-midnight)
   - Identified root cause: scheduler treating blocks as capacity buckets, not time constraints

### ðŸ”´ Current Issues
1. **Tests Need Update**
   - Schedule generation tests expect old behavior
   - Need to test optimal scheduler separately
   - 3 tests failing in ScheduleGenerator.test.tsx

2. **PR Feedback Not Addressed**
   - Need to check and respond to PR comments
   - Schedule generation needs "heavy review" per user

### ðŸŸ¢ Current Code Status
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0 âœ…
- **ESLint Errors**: 0 âœ… (warnings exist)
- **Test Status**: 3 failing (need update)
- **Build**: Successful âœ…

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. Update tests for new optimal scheduler
2. Address PR feedback
3. Complete testing of optimal schedule generation
4. Consider making sleep hours configurable

### ðŸ“š Key Technical Details

#### Optimal Scheduler Algorithm
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Calculates longest dependency chains
- **Priority Sorting**: Deadlines > Async triggers > Critical path > Priority
- **Smart Breaks**: Every 3 hours continuous work, 15-minute break
- **Sleep Avoidance**: 11pm-7am blocked for sleep
- **Meeting Respect**: Works around scheduled meetings
- **Async Optimization**: Starts long async tasks early for parallelization

#### Architecture Impact
- `flexible-scheduler.ts`: Unchanged, used for manual scheduling
- `deadline-scheduler.ts`: Unchanged, used for balanced/async modes
- `optimal-scheduler.ts`: New, used for optimal mode only
- `ScheduleGenerator.tsx`: Updated to offer 3 modes
