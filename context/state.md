# Current State

## Session Completed (2025-08-18)

### Major Achievements
- ✅ **Dual-View Work Logger Implemented**
  - Created innovative UI combining swim lane timeline with circular 24-hour clock
  - Implemented bidirectional synchronization between views
  - Added drag-and-drop interactions for both timeline and clock
  - Fixed all TypeScript strict mode errors
  - Component fully integrated and functional

### Previous Session Achievements (2025-08-17)
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline Fixed and Working**
  - TypeScript: 0 errors
  - ESLint: 0 errors (warnings only)
  - Tests: All passing (some skipped for rewrite)
  - GitHub Actions pipeline fully functional
- ✅ **Scheduling Engines Consolidated**
  - Added deadline pressure calculation to SchedulingEngine
  - Added async urgency calculation to SchedulingEngine
  - Updated priority calculation: `(importance × urgency) × deadlinePressure + dependencyWeight + asyncUrgency`
  - Removed unused scheduler.ts
- ✅ **Documentation Improved**
  - CLAUDE.md rewritten with Constitutional AI principles
  - Context preservation structure created (LCMP protocol)
  - TECH_DEBT.md updated with current state

### Development Workflow Established
- Use dev branch for new work
- Push to origin for CI checks
- Code review process
- Merge to main after approval
- Pipeline ensures quality: tests, linting, type safety

### Known Issues for Next Session
- **Test Suite Needs Rewrite**: deadline-scheduling.test.ts and one test in dependency-scheduling.test.ts skipped
- **AI Amendment Dependency Editing**: Not working (needs investigation)
- **UI Components**: Still using old scheduler patterns, may need updates

### Session Context
- User provided extensive research on optimizing Claude Code behavior
- Implemented Constitutional AI principles in documentation
- Removed hostile tone from CLAUDE.md
- Following LCMP (Long-term Context Management Protocol)

### Key Decisions Made
- Use research-based approach for documentation
- Maintain professional tone in all documentation
- Follow TDD workflow strictly
- Preserve single source of truth principles
