- Identify refactoring opportunities
- Increase test coverage by 10%

## Session Completed (2025-08-19 - Earlier)

### Major Achievements
- ✅ **Dual-View Work Logger Feature Complete**
  - Fixed session creation in timeline view (was showing "Unknown Task")
  - Fixed React 19 compatibility issues with Arco components
  - Added zoom controls for better UI density (horizontal and vertical)
  - Fixed workflow collapse/expand functionality
  - Fixed duplicate key warnings
  - Added overlap validation for sessions
  - Fixed foreign key constraint errors
  - All tests passing (269 passed, 39 skipped)
  - TypeScript: 0 errors
  - ESLint: 0 errors (warnings only)
  - Build successful

### Bug Fixes Completed
- Fixed lane ID parsing for UUID task IDs containing hyphens
- Fixed session preview visibility in timeline during drag operations
- Fixed collapsed workflows preserving gaps instead of merging
- Fixed React 19 compatibility by replacing Message with Notification
- Fixed test assertions for multiple hour labels (12 and 6 appear twice)

### Previous Session Achievements (2025-08-18)
- ✅ **Dual-View Work Logger Implemented**
  - Created innovative UI combining swim lane timeline with circular 24-hour clock
  - Implemented bidirectional synchronization between views
  - Added drag-and-drop interactions for both timeline and clock
  - Fixed all TypeScript strict mode errors
  - Component fully integrated and functional

### Previous Session Achievements (2025-08-17)
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline Fixed and Working**
  - TypeScript: 0 errors
  - ESLint: 0 errors (warnings only)
  - Tests: All passing (some skipped for rewrite)
  - GitHub Actions pipeline fully functional
- ✅ **Scheduling Engines Consolidated**
  - Added deadline pressure calculation to SchedulingEngine
  - Added async urgency calculation to SchedulingEngine
  - Updated priority calculation: `(importance × urgency) × deadlinePressure + dependencyWeight + asyncUrgency`
  - Removed unused scheduler.ts
- ✅ **Documentation Improved**
  - CLAUDE.md rewritten with Constitutional AI principles
  - Context preservation structure created (LCMP protocol)
  - TECH_DEBT.md updated with current state

### Development Workflow Established
- Use dev branch for new work
- Push to origin for CI checks
- Code review process
- Merge to main after approval
- Pipeline ensures quality: tests, linting, type safety

### Known Issues for Next Session
- **Test Suite Needs Rewrite**: deadline-scheduling.test.ts and one test in dependency-scheduling.test.ts skipped
- **AI Amendment Dependency Editing**: Not working (needs investigation)
- **UI Components**: Still using old scheduler patterns, may need updates
- **Personal Task Category**: Verify personal tasks are scheduled correctly in personal blocks

### Session Context
- User emphasized good software engineering practices throughout
- Focused on completing the user story for drag-and-drop work session logging
- Fixed issues systematically with extensive logging for debugging
- Maintained compact approach with clear end goal
- Added request to look for dead code and refactoring opportunities

### Key Decisions Made
- Use lane object properties (taskId, stepId) directly instead of parsing IDs
- Keep individual collapsed workflow sessions with isCollapsed flag instead of merging
- Replace deprecated React components for React 19 compatibility
- Maintain focus on feature completion and CI readiness
- Enhance debug info to better track empty time blocks
