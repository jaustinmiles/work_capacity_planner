# Current State

## Latest Status (2025-09-01, Evening Session)

### 🚀 Current Session: Multiple Critical Fixes (Branch: fix/workflow-notes-not-saving)

#### Critical Bug #2 Fixed (2025-09-01) 🔴 → ✅
**Issue**: Time tracking notes not being saved to workflow steps
- **Root Cause**: Notes were saved to WorkSession table but not to TaskStep.notes field
- **Impact**: Users lost all notes entered during time tracking
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Updated completeStep to save notes to step
  2. Updated logWorkSession to append notes with timestamps
  3. Fixed updateTaskStep type signature to accept notes
  4. Added logging for note operations
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive unit tests for notes persistence

#### High Priority Bug #4 Fixed (2025-09-01) 🔴 → ✅
**Issue**: Workflow start/stop not tracking time
- **Root Cause**: pauseWorkOnStep didn't create WorkSession records
- **Impact**: Time spent working was lost when pausing workflow steps
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Updated pauseWorkOnStep to create WorkSession when pausing
  2. Ensures all work sessions end at current time and extend backward
  3. Fixed time direction for all WorkSession creation
  4. Added automatic duration updates when pausing
- **Test Coverage**: Added 7 comprehensive tests for workflow time tracking

#### Time Direction Fix (2025-09-01) ✅
- All WorkSessions now correctly end at "now" and extend backward
- Prevents future time entries and maintains accurate time logs
- Applied to: pauseWorkOnStep, completeStep, logWorkSession

**Status**: PR #43 updated with all fixes

### 🚀 Previous Session: Critical Bug Fix - Personal Workflow Steps (Branch: fix/personal-workflow-step-inheritance)

#### Critical Bug Fixed (2025-08-31) 🔴 → ✅
**Issue**: Steps do not inherit 'personal' from workflow
- **Root Cause**: Step type selector only allowed Focused/Admin options
- **Impact**: Personal workflows couldn't be scheduled - steps looked for wrong block types
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Added Personal option to step type selector
  2. Steps now default to parent workflow type
  3. All three types (Focused/Admin/Personal) available for steps
  4. Display labels and colors updated for Personal type
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive unit tests
- **Status**: Ready for PR

### 🚀 Previous Session: Voice Amendments & Gantt Chart Improvements (Branch: fix/voice-amendment-date-parsing)

#### Voice Amendment Improvements ✅
1. **Date Parsing Fixed**
   - Added current date/time context to AI prompt
   - AI now understands "today", "tonight", relative times
   - Fixed issue where "11 pm" was parsed as January 1st

2. **Amendment UI Enhancements**
   - Added DatePicker for editing deadline dates
   - Deadline display shows full date/time (e.g., "Aug 30, 2025, 11:00 PM")
   - Dependencies field changed from text input to multi-select dropdown
   - AI prompt improved to handle "depends on all other steps"

#### Gantt Chart Display Fixes ✅
1. **Time Range Improvements**
   - Chart now shows full day (midnight to midnight) instead of just scheduled items
   - Fixed issue where only 1-2 time markers showed for short task windows
   
2. **Hour Labels & Grid**
   - Dynamic hour intervals: every hour when zoomed in (≥60px/hour), every 2 hours when zoomed out
   - Grid lines match hour label intervals
   - Debug text shows marker count and interval
   
3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Added "Snap to Now" button to jump to current time
   - Row labels have proper z-index to prevent overlap with blocks
   - Time labels have improved styling with borders and background

### 🚀 Previous Accomplishments (PR #38 - Merged)

#### Time Provider System for Development Testing
1. **Global Time Control** ✅
   - Created TimeProvider singleton for consistent time across app
   - LocalStorage persistence for dev time overrides
   - Event system integration for UI updates
   - Console commands: setTime(), advanceTime(), clearTime()

2. **Scheduler Async Wait Optimization** ✅  
   - Prevents unnecessary workflow splitting across days
   - Keeps bedtime routines together when async wait completes same day
   - Fixed: 80-minute bedtime routine no longer splits Friday PM/Monday AM

3. **Test Coverage Improvements** ✅
   - Added 19 comprehensive TimeProvider tests
   - Created async-wait-scheduling tests
   - Excluded scripts/ directory from coverage metrics
   - All tests passing with 0 TypeScript/ESLint errors

### 🚀 Previous Session: Comprehensive Scheduling System Fixes

#### Critical Scheduling Bugs Fixed (Branch: feature/universal-task-quick-edit)
1. **Sleep blocks deleted during schedule generation** ✅
   - Schedule generator was overwriting existing meetings with empty array
   - Now fetches and preserves existing meetings/sleep blocks when generating
   - Passes existing meetings to optimal scheduler for proper avoidance

2. **Flexible blocks broken on day 1** ✅
   - Ensured all block types use 'flexible' instead of 'mixed'
   - Better initialization and capacity tracking

3. **Sleep blocks cut off at midnight in UI** ✅
   - Fixed type checking in GanttChart for sleep block detection
   - Sleep blocks with type 'blocked-time' now render with moon icon

4. **Comprehensive logging added** ✅
   - Added detailed logging to schedule generation process
   - Logs existing meetings found, work patterns created
   - Better debugging for future issues

5. **Fixed undefined array access** ✅
   - Added safety check for sortedItems array access
   - Prevents potential runtime errors when accessing first element
   - Identified need for stricter ESLint rules (added to TECH_DEBT.md)

6. **Fixed incorrect unscheduled items tracking** ✅
   - Scheduler was incorrectly reporting items as unscheduled
   - Items remained in workItems array after being scheduled
   - Fixed by properly tracking scheduled item IDs and cleaning up arrays

7. **Fixed task splitting issues** ✅
   - Split tasks weren't being scheduled properly
   - Remainder items had same ID as originals causing tracking issues
   - Fixed by correctly handling partial schedules and remainders

8. **Fixed capacity calculation for optimal schedules** ✅
   - Was setting block capacity to USED amount instead of AVAILABLE
   - Now correctly sets available capacity for flexible blocks
   - Creates default 9-5 blocks for future days with proper capacity

#### Major Accomplishments (PR #31 - Merged)
1. **Unified Scheduling Logic** ✅
   - Created `scheduling-common.ts` with shared utilities
   - Eliminated duplicate code between schedulers
   - Consistent dependency handling across application
   - Topological sort now used in optimal scheduler
   - Fixed self-reference and circular dependency handling

2. **Removed ALL Hardcoded Weekend Assumptions** ✅
   - No more automatic weekend personal blocks
   - No special treatment for weekends vs weekdays
   - Scheduler respects user-defined work patterns only
   - Default work hours apply to ALL days equally
   - Personal blocks created ONLY when personal tasks exist

3. **Fixed Critical Scheduling Bugs** ✅
   - Midnight boundary bug (blocks going past 23:59) - FIXED
   - Stack overflow in topological sort - FIXED
   - CI test failures with Date comparisons - FIXED
   - All 'mixed' block types changed to 'flexible' for optimization

4. **Fixed Async Workflow Scheduling** ✅
   - Tasks now scheduled after async wait times properly
   - Read actual isAsyncTrigger and asyncWaitTime from workflow steps
   - Added comprehensive test for 24-hour async waits
   - Async workflows properly optimize with parallel wait times

5. **Scheduler Architecture Improvements** ✅

   - Critical path calculation unified
   - Dependency checking logic consolidated
   - Work item conversion standardized

#### Testing & Quality
1. **All Tests Passing** ✅
   - 364 tests passing, 42 skipped
