## Latest Status (2025-09-08, TDD Violation Recovery - PR #67)

### 🚨 Current Session: TDD Violation Recovery - PR #67

**Branch**: feature/start-next-task  
**Issue**: CI pipeline failures due to mock-only implementation  
**Status**: Fixed Phase 1 implementation with real database methods

**Critical Problem Identified:**
- WorkTrackingService was implemented using database methods that only existed in test mocks
- All 25 tests passing locally but CI failing due to package-lock.json sync issues
- Production code was non-functional due to optional chaining around missing methods

**Recovery Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ **Fixed GitHub Bot Authentication**
   - Ran `./context/setup-claude-bot.sh` for proper PR attribution
   - All future commits will be as Claude Code[bot]

2. ✅ **Resolved CI Package Issues**  
   - Updated package-lock.json with `npm install`
   - Fixed missing dependencies causing CI build failures

3. ✅ **Refactored WorkTrackingService to Use Real Database Methods**
   - **BEFORE**: Used mock-only methods like `saveActiveWorkSession?.()`
   - **AFTER**: Uses real methods like `createWorkSession()`, `updateWorkSession()`
   - Removed `TestDatabaseService` interface with optional methods
   - Service now actually persists data to database in production

4. ✅ **Updated Test Mocks to Match Reality**
   - Changed mocks from fictional methods to real database API
   - All 25 tests still passing with production-compatible code
   - Tests now validate real behavior, not mock interactions

5. ✅ **Documentation Updates** 
   - Enhanced CLAUDE.md with TDD phase completion requirements
   - Added context/insights.md section on TDD violation patterns
   - Clear guidance on avoiding mock-only implementations

**Current Code Status:**
- **WorkTrackingService Tests**: 25/25 passing ✅
- **Real Database Integration**: Functional ✅  
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0 ✅
- **Package Dependencies**: Synced ✅

### 🚀 Recent PR Completions

#### PR #64: EisenhowerMatrix Refactor (Merged)
- **Achievement**: Reduced component from 1500+ to 182 lines (87% reduction)
- **Method**: Split into Grid, Scatter, and container components
- **Result**: Better maintainability, easier testing, cleaner architecture

#### PR #65: Responsive & E2E Test Fixes (Merged)
- **Achievement**: Fixed 100+ failing E2E tests
- **Method**: Systematic one-by-one fixing with user collaboration
- **Result**: All desktop tests passing, mobile tests strategically skipped

### 🟢 Current Code Status
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0 ✅
- **ESLint Errors**: 0 ✅
- **All E2E Tests**: Passing (desktop) or skipped (mobile) ✅
- **Build**: Successful ✅
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained above main branch requirement ✅

### 📊 Key Metrics from Recent Work

#### Code Quality Improvements
- EisenhowerMatrix: 1500+ → 182 lines (main component)
- Test fixes: 100+ tests repaired
- Component count: 1 monolith → 3 focused components

#### Time Investment
- PR #64 (Refactor): ~6 hours
- PR #65 (Test fixes): ~4 hours
- Documentation: ~2 hours

### 🎯 Next Priorities

Based on user feedback and retrospective analysis:

1. **Immediate**
   - Add data-testid attributes to critical UI elements
   - Create shared E2E test utilities
   - Document remaining Arco patterns

2. **Short Term**
   - Implement visual regression testing
   - Create automated test generation patterns
   - Consolidate test helpers

3. **Long Term**
   - Consider Arco component replacement for testability
   - Implement proper visual regression pipeline
   - Optimize test execution speed

### 💡 Key Learnings Applied

1. **Git Workflow**: Always rebase on main before starting work
2. **Testing**: Fix tests one by one, not in batches
3. **Selectors**: Use simple text selectors over structural ones
4. **Collaboration**: Get actual HTML from user when debugging
5. **Documentation**: Update context files immediately after major work

### 🏗️ Technical Debt Addressed

- ✅ Massive component refactored (EisenhowerMatrix)
- ✅ E2E test infrastructure stabilized
- ✅ Mobile testing strategy clarified
- ✅ Documentation significantly improved

### 📚 Documentation Status

All documentation updated and current:
- `/docs/retrospective-pr64-pr65.md` - Complete retrospective
- `/docs/e2e-testing-patterns.md` - E2E testing guide
- `/context/insights.md` - Updated with latest patterns
- `/context/decisions.md` - Architectural decisions documented
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Enhanced with E2E testing guidance
- `/context/state.md` - This file, now current
