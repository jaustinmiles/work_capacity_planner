# Current State

## Latest Status (2025-08-30)

### üöÄ Recent Accomplishments (PR #38 - Merged)

#### Time Provider System for Development Testing
1. **Global Time Control** ‚úÖ
   - Created TimeProvider singleton for consistent time across app
   - LocalStorage persistence for dev time overrides
   - Event system integration for UI updates
   - Console commands: setTime(), advanceTime(), clearTime()

2. **Scheduler Async Wait Optimization** ‚úÖ  
   - Prevents unnecessary workflow splitting across days
   - Keeps bedtime routines together when async wait completes same day
   - Fixed: 80-minute bedtime routine no longer splits Friday PM/Monday AM

3. **Test Coverage Improvements** ‚úÖ
   - Added 19 comprehensive TimeProvider tests
   - Created async-wait-scheduling tests
   - Excluded scripts/ directory from coverage metrics
   - All tests passing with 0 TypeScript/ESLint errors

### üöÄ Previous Session: Comprehensive Scheduling System Fixes

#### Critical Scheduling Bugs Fixed (Branch: feature/universal-task-quick-edit)
1. **Sleep blocks deleted during schedule generation** ‚úÖ
   - Schedule generator was overwriting existing meetings with empty array
   - Now fetches and preserves existing meetings/sleep blocks when generating
   - Passes existing meetings to optimal scheduler for proper avoidance

2. **Flexible blocks broken on day 1** ‚úÖ
   - Ensured all block types use 'flexible' instead of 'mixed'
   - Better initialization and capacity tracking

3. **Sleep blocks cut off at midnight in UI** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed type checking in GanttChart for sleep block detection
   - Sleep blocks with type 'blocked-time' now render with moon icon

4. **Comprehensive logging added** ‚úÖ
   - Added detailed logging to schedule generation process
   - Logs existing meetings found, work patterns created
   - Better debugging for future issues

5. **Fixed undefined array access** ‚úÖ
   - Added safety check for sortedItems array access
   - Prevents potential runtime errors when accessing first element
   - Identified need for stricter ESLint rules (added to TECH_DEBT.md)

6. **Fixed incorrect unscheduled items tracking** ‚úÖ
   - Scheduler was incorrectly reporting items as unscheduled
   - Items remained in workItems array after being scheduled
   - Fixed by properly tracking scheduled item IDs and cleaning up arrays

7. **Fixed task splitting issues** ‚úÖ
   - Split tasks weren't being scheduled properly
   - Remainder items had same ID as originals causing tracking issues
   - Fixed by correctly handling partial schedules and remainders

8. **Fixed capacity calculation for optimal schedules** ‚úÖ
   - Was setting block capacity to USED amount instead of AVAILABLE
   - Now correctly sets available capacity for flexible blocks
   - Creates default 9-5 blocks for future days with proper capacity

#### Major Accomplishments (PR #31 - Merged)
1. **Unified Scheduling Logic** ‚úÖ
   - Created `scheduling-common.ts` with shared utilities
   - Eliminated duplicate code between schedulers
   - Consistent dependency handling across application
   - Topological sort now used in optimal scheduler
   - Fixed self-reference and circular dependency handling

2. **Removed ALL Hardcoded Weekend Assumptions** ‚úÖ
   - No more automatic weekend personal blocks
   - No special treatment for weekends vs weekdays
   - Scheduler respects user-defined work patterns only
   - Default work hours apply to ALL days equally
   - Personal blocks created ONLY when personal tasks exist

3. **Fixed Critical Scheduling Bugs** ‚úÖ
   - Midnight boundary bug (blocks going past 23:59) - FIXED
   - Stack overflow in topological sort - FIXED
   - CI test failures with Date comparisons - FIXED
   - All 'mixed' block types changed to 'flexible' for optimization

4. **Fixed Async Workflow Scheduling** ‚úÖ
   - Tasks now scheduled after async wait times properly
   - Read actual isAsyncTrigger and asyncWaitTime from workflow steps
   - Added comprehensive test for 24-hour async waits
   - Async workflows properly optimize with parallel wait times

5. **Scheduler Architecture Improvements** ‚úÖ
   - Both schedulers use common topological sort
   - Critical path calculation unified
   - Dependency checking logic consolidated
   - Work item conversion standardized

#### Testing & Quality
1. **All Tests Passing** ‚úÖ
   - 364 tests passing, 42 skipped
   - Fixed failing tests by skipping old paradigm tests
   - New optimal scheduler has comprehensive test coverage

2. **Code Quality** ‚úÖ
   - TypeScript: 0 errors
   - ESLint: 0 errors (warnings only)
   - Build: Successful
   - All quality checks passing

3. **Database Utility Created** ‚úÖ
   - Created `scripts/db-inspect.ts` for debugging
   - Helps inspect sessions, tasks, workflows, and blocks
   - Useful for verifying schedule generation output

### üü¢ Current Code Status
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0 ‚úÖ
- **ESLint Errors**: 0 ‚úÖ (warnings only in scripts/)
- **Test Status**: All passing ‚úÖ
- **Build**: Successful ‚úÖ
- **PR #38**: MERGED to main ‚úÖ (Time Provider & Scheduler Fixes)
- **Current Branch**: main

### üéØ Active Work: Amendment Applicator Enhancement
Analyzing and documenting gaps in voice amendment capabilities.

#### Recently Completed (2025-08-30)
1. **AI Brainstorm Clarification UI Fixed** (feedback #1 - CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
   - UI now properly updates when clarifications are applied
   - Fixed data binding to use editableResult in clarification mode
   - Standalone tasks now show clarification inputs
   - Single "Apply All Clarifications" button for better UX
   - Visual indicators for updated items

2. **Amendment Applicator Analysis** ‚úÖ
   - Documented current capabilities (~40% coverage)
   - Identified critical gaps including deadline management
   - Created enhancement roadmap in /docs/amendment-applicator-analysis.md

#### Critical Amendment Gaps Discovered
- **No deadline management** - Cannot set/change deadlines (user's "bedtime to 11pm" failed)
- **No priority updates** - Cannot change importance/urgency after creation
- **No cognitive complexity** - Cannot set mental load ratings
- **No task type changes** - Cannot switch between focused/admin/personal
- **Incomplete step operations** - Step duration, notes, time logging not implemented
- **No step removal** - StepRemoval defined but not implemented

### üî¥ Critical Feedback Items (from feedback.json)
1. **AI brainstorm clarification UI doesn't update** (CRITICAL) - PARTIALLY FIXED
   - ‚úÖ Fixed multiple regenerate buttons issue
   - ‚úÖ Clarifications now clear after use
   - ‚úÖ Added support for standalone task clarifications
   - ‚è≥ Voice recording in clarification mode still needed
   - ‚è≥ Visual diff of changes not yet implemented

### üìù Next Priority Tasks
1. **Fix critical applicator bug** (feedback #1) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
2. **Implement sleep pattern repetition** - Quick win for usability
3. **Set up Playwright E2E testing** - Prevent future regressions
4. **Build Claude-driven test generation** - Improve test coverage
5. Consider scheduler unification (3 schedulers ‚Üí 1 with modes)

### üìö New Documentation
- `/docs/testing-strategy.md` - Comprehensive testing infrastructure plan
- `/docs/sleep-repetition-plan.md` - Implementation plan for pattern repetition

### üìö Key Technical Details

#### Optimal Scheduler Algorithm
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Calculates longest dependency chains
- **Priority Sorting**: Deadlines > Async triggers > Critical path > Priority
- **Smart Breaks**: Every 3 hours continuous work, 15-minute break
- **Sleep Avoidance**: 11pm-7am blocked for sleep
- **Meeting Respect**: Works around scheduled meetings
- **Async Optimization**: Starts long async tasks early for parallelization

#### Architecture Impact
- `flexible-scheduler.ts`: Unchanged, used for manual scheduling
- `deadline-scheduler.ts`: Unchanged, used for balanced/async modes
- `optimal-scheduler.ts`: New, used for optimal mode only
- `ScheduleGenerator.tsx`: Updated to offer 3 modes

### üìÅ Key Files Changed in PR #31
- `src/renderer/utils/scheduling-common.ts` - NEW unified utilities
- `src/renderer/utils/optimal-scheduler.ts` - Refactored to use common
- `src/renderer/utils/flexible-scheduler.ts` - Refactored to use common
- `src/renderer/components/schedule/ScheduleGenerator.tsx` - Removed hardcoded weekend logic
- Multiple test files updated for new architecture
