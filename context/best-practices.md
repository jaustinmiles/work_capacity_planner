# Development Best Practices

*Last Updated: 2025-09-02*

## What Makes a "Perfect" PR

Based on PR #43 which was described as "basically perfect", here are the key elements:

### 1. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
- Tests must FAIL initially to prove they're valid
- Cover all edge cases (with notes, without notes, multiple cycles)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario

### 2. Zero Tolerance for Errors
- **TypeScript**: 0 errors required
- **ESLint**: 0 errors required (warnings in scripts/ are acceptable)
- **All Tests**: Must pass before pushing
- **No Regression**: Existing tests must continue passing

### 3. Proper Git Workflow
- **NEVER use `--no-verify`** to bypass pre-push hooks
- Atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Commit tests separately from implementation

### 4. Three-Layer Bug Fixing
When fixing bugs, always check:
1. **Store Layer**: Business logic in Zustand stores
2. **Database Layer**: Persistence operations  
3. **UI Layer**: Component connections and user interactions

Missing any layer can leave bugs partially fixed.

### 5. Mock Testing Patterns
For Vitest with hoisted mocks:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Define inline and export
vi.mock('./module', () => {
  const mockFn = vi.fn()
  return {
    getDatabase: () => ({ method: mockFn }),
    __mocks: { mockFn }  // Export for test access
  }
})

// ❌ WRONG - External variables undefined during hoisting
const mockFn = vi.fn()
vi.mock('./module', () => ({
  getDatabase: () => ({ method: mockFn }) // mockFn is undefined!
}))
```

### 6. Time Tracking Principles
- Work sessions END at current time and extend BACKWARD
- Calculate: `startTime = new Date(Date.now() - minutes * 60000)`
- Store in both WorkSession (history) and TaskStep (current state)

### 7. PR Description Structure
A good PR description includes:
- **Summary**: Brief overview of changes
- **Problems Fixed**: List each issue with details
- **Solutions**: Technical approach for each fix
- **Test Coverage**: List of tests added
- **Manual Testing Checklist**: Steps for reviewers to verify

### 8. Development Process
1. **Search First**: Look for existing implementations
2. **Read Tests**: Understand expected behavior
3. **Write New Tests**: Define your requirements
4. **Implement Minimally**: Just enough to pass tests
5. **Verify Quality**: Run full test suite
6. **Update Context**: Document learnings in `/context/`

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Skipping the Search Phase
- Always search for similar functionality before implementing
- Check existing patterns in the codebase
- Look for TODOs related to your task

### 2. Incomplete Testing
- Don't just test the happy path
- Test with missing data, empty states, edge cases
- Verify mock functions are actually called

### 3. Ignoring Async Patterns
- Database operations are async - handle them properly
- Make store methods async when they do DB operations
- Use proper error handling for all async code

### 4. Missing Documentation
- Update `/context/` files after significant work
- Document architectural decisions in `decisions.md`
- Record insights and patterns in `insights.md`
- Keep `state.md` current with session progress

### 5. UI-Only Fixes
- Don't just fix the visual issue
- Ensure data persistence is correct
- Verify state management is properly connected

## Quality Checklist

Before marking any task complete:

- [ ] `npm run typecheck` - 0 errors
- [ ] `npm run lint` - 0 errors  
- [ ] `npm test -- --run` - All pass
- [ ] `npm run build` - Successful
- [ ] Context files updated
- [ ] Commits are atomic with clear messages
- [ ] No `--no-verify` flag used
- [ ] PR description is comprehensive

## Testing Hierarchy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Test full user workflows (when available)
4. **Manual Testing**: Verify UI/UX feels right

## Code Review Readiness

Your code is ready for review when:
- All automated checks pass
- You've manually tested the changes
- Documentation is updated
- You can explain every change made
- You're confident in the solution

## PR Review Response Protocol

### Mandatory Steps When Addressing Review Feedback
1. **Retrieve all comments**: Use `gh pr view [PR#] --comments` or check GitHub UI
2. **Create a checklist** of all feedback items
3. **Address each item**:
   - Implement requested changes
   - OR explain why change wasn't made
   - OR ask for clarification if unclear
4. **Verify circular dependencies**: If reviewer mentions circular patterns, trace the full flow
5. **Test the actual user flow**: Don't just run unit tests, manually verify the fix works
6. **Document what was changed** in response to each comment

### Common Review Feedback Patterns
- **"This seems circular"**: You have a confusing dependency chain, simplify the flow
- **"Where is this defined?"**: Missing imports, unclear variable sources, or poor naming
- **"Why is this different?"**: Inconsistent patterns, should reuse existing code
- **Code duplication**: Extract to shared utilities or components
- **Unclear logic**: Add comments or refactor for clarity

### Example: Circular Dependency Pattern
When reviewer says "this seems circular":
```javascript
// ❌ BAD - Circular pattern
Component passes onChange to DependencyEditor
  → DependencyEditor calls onChange
  → onChange updates form
  → Form triggers re-render
  → Component passes new onChange to DependencyEditor
  → Creates confusion about data flow

// ✅ GOOD - Clear unidirectional flow
Component has local state
  → Passes state value to DependencyEditor
  → DependencyEditor calls onChange with new value
  → Component updates local state
  → Component updates form for submission
  → Clear data flow
```

## Performance Considerations

- Batch database operations when possible
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Consider debouncing for user input handlers

## Security Principles

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Follow principle of least privilege

## Maintenance Mindset

Write code as if the person maintaining it is:
- A violent psychopath who knows where you live
- Actually just you in 6 months who has forgotten everything
- Someone new to the codebase trying to fix a critical bug

Therefore:
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Comment the "why", not the "what"
- Follow existing patterns consistently
- Keep functions small and focused
- Make dependencies explicit
