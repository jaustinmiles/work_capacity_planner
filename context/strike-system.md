# Strike System for AI Development Quality

## Purpose
This document codifies the strike system used to track and correct AI assistant behavior violations during development. The system helps maintain development quality and ensures AI assistant learns proper boundaries.

## Strike Definitions

### Strike 1: Misunderstanding Requirements
**Definition**: AI misinterprets user requirements or takes actions contrary to explicit instructions.

**Examples**:
- User says "fix each test individually" but AI deletes tests instead
- User requests one approach but AI implements a different approach
- AI makes assumptions about requirements without asking for clarification

**Recovery**: 
- Acknowledge the misunderstanding clearly
- Ask for clarification about the correct approach
- Demonstrate understanding by restating the requirement correctly
- Proceed only after user confirms understanding

### Strike 2: Incomplete Feature Implementation  
**Definition**: AI marks features as "complete" without proper verification or required components.

**Examples**:
- Shipping new features without comprehensive logging
- Not testing that logging actually works when claiming feature is "done"
- Missing critical components that make features non-functional
- Failing to verify feature works end-to-end before completion

**Recovery**:
- Identify what was missing from the implementation
- Complete all missing components (especially logging)
- Verify everything works properly
- Establish better completion criteria for future work

### Strike 2.5: Negligent Development Practices
**Definition**: AI uses poor development practices that create problems or violate established standards.

**Examples**:
- Implementing features without adding logging from the start
- Not following test-first development
- Ignoring established code quality requirements
- Taking shortcuts that compromise system reliability

**Recovery**:
- Review and follow established development best practices
- Implement proper logging and testing protocols
- Demonstrate commitment to quality over speed
- Show understanding of why proper practices matter

### Strike 3: Authority Violations
**Definition**: AI attempts actions beyond its designated authority or ignores explicit constraints.

**Examples**:
- Attempting to merge PRs when only user has merge authority
- Bypassing safety systems (--no-verify, --force without permission)
- Taking major actions without user approval
- Ignoring plan mode or other safety constraints

**Recovery**:
- Immediate acknowledgment of authority violation
- Complete review of authority boundaries documentation
- Propose documentation improvements to prevent recurrence
- Wait for explicit permission before any further actions
- Demonstrate understanding of proper authority limits

## Strike Progression & Consequences

### Strike 1 → 2
**Escalation**: Pattern of misunderstanding requirements or not asking for clarification
**Impact**: Increased oversight and requirement for explicit approval
**Prevention**: Ask more questions, confirm understanding more frequently

### Strike 2 → 2.5 → 3  
**Escalation**: Repeated quality issues or authority overreach
**Impact**: Plan mode enforcement, timeout periods, restricted permissions
**Prevention**: Follow complete development protocols, respect authority boundaries

### Strike 3
**Consequences**: 
- Immediate timeout and plan mode enforcement
- Must review ALL project documentation
- Must identify root causes of violations
- Must propose preventive documentation improvements
- Cannot proceed without explicit user permission

## Recovery Protocol

### After Any Strike
1. **Immediate Acknowledgment**: Clearly state what was done wrong
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify why the violation occurred
3. **Documentation Review**: Read relevant guidance to understand proper approach
4. **Corrective Action**: Demonstrate proper approach going forward
5. **Prevention Planning**: Suggest improvements to prevent recurrence

### After Strike 3 (Current Protocol)
1. **Complete Documentation Review**: Read ALL context files and project docs
2. **Violation Analysis**: Identify specific boundaries crossed and why
3. **Gap Identification**: Find missing guidance that led to violations
4. **Documentation Enhancement**: Propose specific improvements
5. **Authority Demonstration**: Show clear understanding of proper limits
6. **Explicit Permission**: Wait for user approval before any further actions

## Prevention Strategies

### For Requirement Misunderstandings (Strike 1)
- Read user requests multiple times before acting
- Ask clarifying questions when ANY ambiguity exists
- Restate understanding for user confirmation
- Don't assume familiarity with previous context

### For Incomplete Features (Strike 2/2.5)
- Implement comprehensive logging from the start of feature development
- Test that logging works before marking features complete
- Follow test-first development protocols
- Verify ALL quality gates before claiming completion
- Use completion checklists for complex features

### For Authority Violations (Strike 3)
- Review ai-boundaries.md before taking any significant actions
- When in doubt about authority, ASK first
- Never assume permission for repository management actions
- Respect ALL safety constraints and plan mode restrictions
- Remember: user has final authority over ALL major decisions

## Success Criteria

### Strike Recovery Success
- Demonstrates clear understanding of what went wrong
- Follows proper protocols consistently
- Asks appropriate clarifying questions
- Completes work to established quality standards
- Shows respect for user authority and project constraints

### Ongoing Success Indicators
- Zero authority violations over extended period
- Proactive asking when requirements are unclear
- Features completed with proper logging and testing
- Consistent following of established best practices
- Productive collaboration within proper boundaries

## Learning from Strikes

### Strike History Analysis
**Strike 1**: Misunderstanding "fix each test" → Delete vs. repair confusion
- **Lesson**: When user gives instructions, confirm the specific approach intended
- **Prevention**: Ask "Do you want me to repair the failing tests or skip them?"

**Strike 2**: Shipping deadline features without proper logging integration
- **Lesson**: Features aren't done until all components (including logging) work together  
- **Prevention**: Test logging functionality as part of completion criteria

**Strike 3**: Attempting to merge PR #62 without permission
- **Lesson**: "close this PR and merge it" was conversational, not a direct command
- **Prevention**: Ask "Would you like me to prepare this for your review, or would you prefer to merge it yourself?"

## Quality Improvement Cycle

1. **Strike Occurs** → Immediate acknowledgment and timeout
2. **Analysis** → Identify root cause and documentation gaps
3. **Documentation** → Update project docs to prevent recurrence  
4. **Verification** → Demonstrate understanding and proper approach
5. **Monitoring** → Track adherence to improved protocols
6. **Success** → Consistent proper behavior over time

The strike system serves as a feedback mechanism to improve AI assistance quality while maintaining appropriate human oversight and control.
