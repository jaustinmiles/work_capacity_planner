# Codebase Cleanup and Optimization Status

## Date: 2025-08-28

### Completed Cleanup Tasks

#### 1. GitHub Actions - Test Coverage Reporting ✅
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include coverage reporting
- Added Codecov integration for coverage tracking
- Added coverage summary to GitHub Actions workflow
- Coverage reports now generated on every PR

#### 2. Duplicate Code Removal ✅
- **Removed**: `src/renderer/components/tasks/TaskForm 2.tsx` - duplicate file
- **Fixed**: Duplicate default sessions bug by implementing race condition prevention
  - Added promise caching to prevent concurrent session creation
  - Added logic to reuse existing sessions before creating new ones
  - Created cleanup script: `scripts/cleanup-duplicate-sessions.js`

#### 3. Code Quality Improvements ✅
- Ran ESLint autofix to clean up formatting issues
- Fixed CircularClock test for dynamic energy labels
- All tests passing with 0 TypeScript errors

### Identified Issues Requiring Further Work

#### High Priority
1. **Logger Consolidation** 
   - Three logging systems exist (legacy electron-log, legacy renderer, new comprehensive)
   - Legacy logger already redirects to new system
   - Need to complete migration and remove legacy files

2. **Scheduler Consolidation**
   - Multiple scheduling engines: deadline-scheduler.ts, flexible-scheduler.ts, scheduling-engine.ts
   - Complex priority calculations duplicated
   - Should consolidate into single scheduler with strategy pattern

#### Medium Priority
3. **UI Component Redundancy**
   - Multiple workflow visualization components may serve similar purposes
   - Work session modals could be unified
   - Need analysis to determine consolidation opportunities

4. **Database Access Patterns**
   - Validation logic duplicated between main and renderer
   - Consider extracting shared validation utilities

### Technical Debt Summary

#### Fixed
- ✅ Duplicate default sessions creation
- ✅ Missing test coverage reporting
- ✅ Duplicate TaskForm component

#### Remaining
- Multiple scheduler implementations
- Logger migration incomplete
- UI component consolidation needed
- Database validation duplication

### Code Health Metrics
- **Tests**: All passing ✅
- **TypeScript**: 0 errors ✅
- **ESLint**: Warnings only (mostly 'any' types and missing return types)
- **Coverage**: Pipeline configured, awaiting first run

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Complete Logger Migration** (3-4 hours)
   - Remove legacy logger files after ensuring no dependencies
   - Update all imports to use new logging system

2. **Scheduler Consolidation** (8-10 hours)
   - Design unified scheduler interface
   - Implement strategy pattern for different scheduling algorithms
   - Migrate all scheduler usage to unified implementation

3. **UI Component Analysis** (2-3 hours)
   - Map component usage and dependencies
   - Identify consolidation opportunities
   - Create refactoring plan

### Files Modified in This Session
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added coverage reporting
- `src/main/database.ts` - Fixed race condition in session creation
- `scripts/cleanup-duplicate-sessions.js` - Created cleanup utility
- `src/renderer/components/tasks/TaskForm 2.tsx` - Removed duplicate
- `src/renderer/components/work-logger/__tests__/CircularClock.test.tsx` - Fixed test

### Migration Scripts Created
- `scripts/cleanup-duplicate-sessions.js` - Removes duplicate default sessions and migrates data
