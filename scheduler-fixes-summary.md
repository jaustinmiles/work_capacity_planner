# Scheduler Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Debug Info Was Being Lost
**Problem**: GanttChart was creating fake debug info instead of using real data from UnifiedScheduler
**Solution**: 
- Modified `unified-scheduler-adapter.ts` to preserve `debugInfo` in `LegacyScheduleResult` interface
- Updated `adaptUnifiedResult()` to pass through `debugInfo: result.debugInfo`
- Fixed `GanttChart.tsx` to import `SchedulingDebugInfo` from `@shared/unified-scheduler` instead of flexible-scheduler
- Now uses real debug info: `const unifiedDebugInfo = legacyScheduleResult.debugInfo`

### 2. ✅ Logger IPC Serialization Error
**Problem**: "Failed to send log via IPC: Error: An object could not be cloned"
**Solution**: 
- Modified `IPCTransport.ts` to sanitize log entries before sending
- Added: `const sanitizedEntry = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(entry))`
- This removes non-serializable objects like functions and circular references

### 3. ✅ Tasks Not Loading Before getNextScheduledItem Call  
**Problem**: WorkStatusWidget was calling `getNextScheduledItem()` with empty tasks/workflows
**Root Cause**: `isLoading` started as `false`, causing immediate execution before data loaded
**Solution**: 
- Changed initial state in `useTaskStore.ts` from `isLoading: false` to `isLoading: true`
- This prevents premature calls to `getNextScheduledItem()` before data is loaded

## Key Findings

### The Real Issue with Scheduling
The logs showed a critical timing issue:
- At 00:04:33.668Z: `{"tasks":[],"sequencedTasks":[]}` - EMPTY
- At 00:04:33.900Z: `{"tasks":[{...full data...}]}` - DATA LOADED

The WorkStatusWidget was checking for next tasks BEFORE the store had loaded them from the database.

### Data IS Loading Correctly
- Database reports: `[DB] getTasks - Found 2 tasks for session`
- Store confirms: `[TaskStore] Data loaded successfully {"taskCount":2,"workflowCount":1,"totalSteps":20`
- The workflow "Complete Scheduler Unification" with 20 steps is present and loading

## What's Actually Working Now

1. **Session Filtering**: Working correctly - only showing tasks from current session
2. **Database Loading**: Successfully loading 2 tasks and 1 workflow with 20 steps
3. **UnifiedScheduler Integration**: GanttChart is using UnifiedScheduler through the adapter
4. **Debug Info Pipeline**: Real debug info flows from UnifiedScheduler → Adapter → GanttChart
5. **Logger Transport**: IPC serialization errors are fixed

## Remaining Issues to Investigate

1. **Work Patterns**: Need to verify if work patterns are being respected by scheduler
2. **Priority Ordering**: Need to verify if high-priority workflows schedule before low-priority tasks
3. **Block Utilization Display**: Should now show real data from debugInfo
4. **Start Next Task Button**: Should now work with proper timing

## Files Modified

1. `/src/shared/unified-scheduler-adapter.ts` - Preserve debug info
2. `/src/renderer/components/timeline/GanttChart.tsx` - Use real debug info
3. `/src/logging/transports/IPCTransport.ts` - Fix serialization
4. `/src/renderer/store/useTaskStore.ts` - Fix timing issue

## Next Steps

1. Verify the UI actually shows the correct scheduling with these fixes
2. Check if Start Next Task button is now enabled
3. Verify block utilization is displayed
4. Run tests to ensure nothing broke
