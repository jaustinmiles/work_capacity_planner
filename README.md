## üéØ Workflow Examples

### Async Workflow Extraction
*Record*: "I need to implement a new feature. First I'll analyze the requirements, then write the code. After that I'll submit for code review which usually takes about a day. Once approved, I'll deploy to staging and wait for QA verification."

*AI Extracts Workflow*:
- **Implement New Feature** (7 steps, ~8 hours active work, 2-3 days total)
  1. Analyze requirements (60 min)
  2. Write implementation code (180 min)
  3. Write unit tests (90 min)
  4. Submit for code review (30 min) ‚Üí Wait 24 hours
  5. Address review feedback (60 min)
  6. Deploy to staging (30 min) ‚Üí Wait 4 hours for CI/CD
  7. Verify with QA (30 min)

### Simple Task Extraction
*Record*: "I need to finish the quarterly report by Friday, it's high priority. Also need to review the marketing campaign designs."

*AI Extracts Tasks*:
- **Finish Quarterly Report** (High Priority, 4 hours, Due Friday)
- **Review Marketing Designs** (Medium Priority, 2 hours)

### Smart Scheduling
The system automatically:
- Prioritizes the quarterly report for immediate scheduling
- Allocates design review to available focused work time
- Schedules administrative tasks during non-focused periods
- Respects daily capacity limits (4h focused + 3h admin)

## Technical Implementation

### Key Features
- **Interactive Workflow Graph**: Drag-and-drop dependency creation with React Flow
- **Eisenhower Matrix Visualization**: Zoom, filter, and interact with priority quadrants
- **Database-Driven Testing**: Integration tests using actual production data backups
- **Unified Task Model**: Single database table for both simple tasks and workflows
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full type safety with zero tolerance for errors
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 100+ tests covering core functionality
- **Debug Tools**: Toggleable debug information for schedule analysis

### Database-Driven Development & Testing

This project uses an effective approach for debugging and testing complex scheduling logic:

1. **Create Real Scenarios**: Build test cases directly in the UI with actual user workflows
2. **Database Backups**: Capture the exact state as SQLite database snapshots
3. **Integration Tests**: Generate tests that load real data and run the same logic as the UI
4. **Perfect Reproduction**: Debug issues with 100% fidelity to user experiences
5. **AI-Assisted Debugging**: Use Claude to analyze database state and generate test cases

This methodology proved particularly valuable for:
- Debugging complex workflow dependency issues
- Ensuring UI and test logic remain synchronized
- Rapidly identifying root causes of scheduling problems
- Creating regression tests from actual user scenarios

## üîß Architecture

### Security Model
- **Process Isolation**: Main and renderer processes properly separated
- **Secure IPC**: All AI/database operations via contextBridge
- **API Key Protection**: Environment variables only in main process
- **No Direct Access**: Renderer cannot directly access filesystem or APIs

### Data Flow
```
Voice Input ‚Üí Whisper API ‚Üí Claude Analysis ‚Üí Task Creation ‚Üí Database ‚Üí UI Update
```
