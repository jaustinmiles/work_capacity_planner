   ```
4. Initialize database: `npx prisma generate`
5. Start development: `npm run start`

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run start          # Start development server
npm run build          # Build for production
npm run typecheck      # Run TypeScript type checking (must pass with 0 errors)
npm run lint           # Run ESLint
npm test              # Run test suite
npm run test:ui       # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Generate test coverage report
npm run prisma:studio # Open Prisma database viewer
npm run prisma:migrate dev # Run database migrations
npm run restart       # Clean restart (kills processes, rebuilds)
npm run check         # Run both typecheck and lint
```

## üéØ Workflow Examples

### Async Workflow Extraction
*Record*: "I need to implement a new feature. First I'll analyze the requirements, then write the code. After that I'll submit for code review which usually takes about a day. Once approved, I'll deploy to staging and wait for QA verification."

*AI Extracts Workflow*:
- **Implement New Feature** (7 steps, ~8 hours active work, 2-3 days total)
  1. Analyze requirements (60 min)
  2. Write implementation code (180 min)
  3. Write unit tests (90 min)
  4. Submit for code review (30 min) ‚Üí Wait 24 hours
  5. Address review feedback (60 min)
  6. Deploy to staging (30 min) ‚Üí Wait 4 hours for CI/CD
  7. Verify with QA (30 min)

### Simple Task Extraction
*Record*: "I need to finish the quarterly report by Friday, it's high priority. Also need to review the marketing campaign designs."

*AI Extracts Tasks*:
- **Finish Quarterly Report** (High Priority, 4 hours, Due Friday)
- **Review Marketing Designs** (Medium Priority, 2 hours)

### Smart Scheduling
The system automatically:
- Prioritizes the quarterly report for immediate scheduling
- Allocates design review to available focused work time
- Schedules administrative tasks during non-focused periods
- Respects daily capacity limits (4h focused + 3h admin)

## üèÜ Technical Achievements

### Advanced Features Implemented
- **Interactive Workflow Graph**: Drag-and-drop dependency creation with React Flow
- **Eisenhower Matrix Visualization**: Zoom, filter, and interact with priority quadrants

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Zero tolerance for type errors across ~15,000 lines
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 116+ tests ensuring reliability
- **Advanced Debugging Tools**: Toggleable debug info for scheduling analysis

### ü§ù AI-Human Collaboration Innovation

This project pioneers a new development paradigm:
1. **UI Workflow Creation**: Human creates test scenarios in the actual app
2. **Database Persistence**: State is captured in SQLite database
3. **Test Case Replication**: AI generates integration tests from real data
4. **Visual Confirmation**: Human verifies behavior matches expectations
5. **Perfect Alignment**: Tests and UI use identical logic and data

This approach achieved in ~60 hours what would traditionally take months, demonstrating the power of human creativity combined with AI capabilities.

## üîß Architecture
