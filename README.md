- **Task Types**: Distinguish between focused work and administrative tasks
- **Duration Tracking**: Realistic time estimates with capacity-based scheduling
- **Batch Operations**: Delete all tasks for development testing (dev mode)

### üéØ Intelligent Scheduling
- **Capacity-Aware Distribution**: Automatically distributes work based on daily limits
- **Priority-Driven**: Tasks scheduled by priority scores and dependencies
- **Timeline Visualization**: Gantt-style timeline showing work distribution
- **Smart Allocation**: Handles partial task allocation across multiple days

### üß† Context Management
- **Job Context**: Persistent context about your role and work patterns
- **Voice Memos**: Add context via voice recordings
- **Industry Jargon**: Build a dictionary of domain-specific terms
- **Context Evolution**: Expand and refine context over time

### üíæ Data Persistence

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
4. Initialize database: `npx prisma generate`
5. Start development: `npm run start`

### Usage
1. **Create Tasks**: Click "Add Task" ‚Üí Choose "AI Brainstorm" for voice input
2. **Record Voice**: Speak naturally about your projects and deadlines
3. **AI Processing**: Claude extracts structured tasks from your speech
4. **Review & Create**: Accept or modify AI suggestions before creating tasks
5. **View Schedule**: Check Timeline view for intelligent work distribution

## üéØ Workflow Examples

### Async Workflow Extraction
*Record*: "I need to implement a new feature. First I'll analyze the requirements, then write the code. After that I'll submit for code review which usually takes about a day. Once approved, I'll deploy to staging and wait for QA verification."

*AI Extracts Workflow*:
- **Implement New Feature** (7 steps, ~8 hours active work, 2-3 days total)
  1. Analyze requirements (60 min)
  2. Write implementation code (180 min)
  3. Write unit tests (90 min)
  4. Submit for code review (30 min) ‚Üí Wait 24 hours
  5. Address review feedback (60 min)
  6. Deploy to staging (30 min) ‚Üí Wait 4 hours for CI/CD
  7. Verify with QA (30 min)

### Simple Task Extraction
*Record*: "I need to finish the quarterly report by Friday, it's high priority. Also need to review the marketing campaign designs."

*AI Extracts Tasks*:
- **Finish Quarterly Report** (High Priority, 4 hours, Due Friday)
- **Review Marketing Designs** (Medium Priority, 2 hours)

### Smart Scheduling
The system automatically:
- Prioritizes the quarterly report for immediate scheduling
- Allocates design review to available focused work time
- Schedules administrative tasks during non-focused periods
- Respects daily capacity limits (4h focused + 3h admin)

## üîß Architecture

### Security Model
- **Process Isolation**: Main and renderer processes properly separated
- **Secure IPC**: All AI/database operations via contextBridge
- **API Key Protection**: Environment variables only in main process
- **No Direct Access**: Renderer cannot directly access filesystem or APIs

### Data Flow
```
Voice Input ‚Üí Whisper API ‚Üí Claude Analysis ‚Üí Task Creation ‚Üí Database ‚Üí UI Update
```
