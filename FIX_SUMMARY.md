# Capacity System Unification - Fix Summary

## What We Fixed

### Core Issue
- **Problem**: Tasks weren't scheduling despite available capacity (36 items unscheduled with 297 minutes available)
- **Root Cause**: Scheduler was returning 0 capacity due to incompatible capacity formats
- **Solution**: Unified capacity system using BlockCapacity interface with totalMinutes, type, and optional splitRatio

### Changes Made

1. **Simplified Capacity System**
   - Old format: `{focus?: number, admin?: number, personal?: number, total?: number, flexible?: number}`
   - New format: `{totalMinutes: number, type: string, splitRatio?: {focus: number, admin: number}}`

2. **Fixed Work Session Duration Tracking**
   - Duration was showing as 0m due to Date object conversion issues
   - Fixed by ensuring startTime is converted to Date before calculating actualMinutes

3. **Made System Backward Compatible**
   - createBlockCapacity() now handles both old and new capacity formats
   - Prevents breaking existing database data

4. **Created Development Tools**
   - log-viewer.ts: Professional log viewer with filtering
   - db-inspector.ts: Database inspection tool

## Tests Fixed (8 of 40)
- ✅ WorkBlockType enum test (now expects 7 values)
- ✅ work-blocks-types capacity test
- ✅ unified-scheduler-adapter metrics tests (2)
- ✅ SchedulingDebugInfo component tests (3)
- ✅ schedule-formatter debug info test

## Remaining Issues (32 tests failing)

### Main Categories:
- 27 tests in src/main/__tests__ (database tests)
- 3 tests in src/test/database-validation.test.ts
- 2 tests in src/renderer/services (session persistence)

### Next Steps:
1. Fix database tests to use new capacity format
2. Update validation tests
3. Fix session persistence issues
4. Push branch and create PR

## Build Status
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ TypeScript checks pass
- ✅ ESLint passes (0 errors, only warnings)
- ❌ Tests: 32 failing (down from 40)
