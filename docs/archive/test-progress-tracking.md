# Progress Tracking Feature Test Plan

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Timer-based Work Session
- [x] Start work on a step using play button
- [x] Pause work session
- [x] Resume work session
- [x] Complete step with accumulated time

### 2. Manual Time Logging
- [x] Click "Log time" button on any step
- [x] Enter time manually (hours and minutes)
- [x] Use quick time buttons (15 min, 30 min, etc.)
- [x] Add notes to time entry
- [x] Save time log

### 3. Complete Step with Time
- [x] Use "Log Time & Complete" button
- [x] Verify step marked as completed
- [x] Check actual duration is saved

### 4. Edge Cases
- [x] Log time on already completed steps
- [x] Log time on pending (not started) steps
- [x] Verify integer parsing (no string/number errors)
- [x] Handle zero time entries gracefully

### 5. Progress Statistics
- [x] View workflow completion percentage
- [x] Check time accuracy metrics
- [x] Verify accumulated time calculations

## Test Results

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ Icon imports changed from lucide-react to @arco-design/web-react/icon
2. ✅ Duration parsing fixed (parseInt for form values)
3. ✅ currentStepId field removed from database updates
4. ✅ getStepWorkSessions method added to database service
5. ✅ Manual time logging available for all task states

### Verified Features:
1. ✅ Timer functionality (play/pause/resume)
2. ✅ Manual time entry with proper integer conversion
3. ✅ Quick time selection buttons
4. ✅ Notes can be added to time logs
5. ✅ "Log Time & Complete" functionality
6. ✅ Progress tracking persists across sessions
7. ✅ Statistics calculate correctly

## Database Verification

The following fields are properly tracked:
- `actualDuration`: Total minutes worked (integer)
- `startedAt`: When work began on step
- `completedAt`: When step was marked complete
- `percentComplete`: Progress percentage (0-100)
- `StepWorkSession` records: Individual work sessions with duration

## UI/UX Verification

- ✅ "Log time" button always visible for all steps
- ✅ Appropriate alerts shown based on step status
- ✅ Modal closes properly after submission
- ✅ Loading states handled correctly
- ✅ Error handling for invalid inputs

## Conclusion

The progress tracking feature is fully functional with all identified issues resolved. Users can:
1. Track time using timer or manual entry
2. Log time on any task regardless of status
3. Complete tasks while logging time
4. View accurate progress statistics
5. Add notes to work sessions

The feature handles all edge cases gracefully and provides a smooth user experience.
