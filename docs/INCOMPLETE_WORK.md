## üö® CRITICAL INCOMPLETE REFACTORINGS

### 1. Scheduler Unification (ATTEMPTED 3+ TIMES, NEVER COMPLETED)

**Status**: ‚ùå INCOMPLETE  
**Progress**: ~30% done  
**Started**: Multiple attempts over several months  
**Last Attempt**: August 2025

#### What EXISTS:
- ‚úÖ `scheduling-engine.ts` - Complete implementation for database persistence
- ‚úÖ Some shared utilities in `scheduling-common.ts`
- ‚úÖ Tests for scheduling-engine work correctly

#### What's STILL INCOMPLETE:
- ‚ùå GanttChart still uses `flexible-scheduler.ts` (line 8)
- ‚ùå WeeklyCalendar still uses `flexible-scheduler.ts` (line 5) 
- ‚ùå `deadline-scheduler.ts` still provides priority calculations
- ‚ùå Different priority formulas between systems (ACTIVE BUG)
- ‚ùå 20+ tests skipped with "needs rewrite for unified scheduler"

#### Migration Status by Component:
```
GanttChart.tsx                  ‚ùå Not migrated (flexible-scheduler import line 8)
WeeklyCalendar.tsx             ‚ùå Not migrated (flexible-scheduler import line 5)
ScheduleGenerator.tsx          ‚úÖ Uses scheduling-engine.ts
optimal-scheduler.ts           ‚ùå Exists but unused (should be deleted)
```

#### Why It Failed:
1. UI components need real-time scheduling for display
2. Database scheduler is async and designed for persistence
3. No adapter layer created between systems
4. Priority calculation bugs never resolved

#### To Complete:
1. Create UI adapter layer for scheduling-engine
2. Fix priority calculation inconsistencies
3. Migrate GanttChart and WeeklyCalendar
4. Remove old scheduler files
5. Un-skip and fix 20+ related tests

### 2. Work Session Type Consolidation (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)

**Status**: ‚ùå INCOMPLETE  
**Progress**: ~40% done  
**Started**: August 2025  
**Last Attempt**: September 2025

#### What EXISTS:
- ‚úÖ `UnifiedWorkSession` interface created
- ‚úÖ Migration adapters: `fromLocalWorkSession()`, `fromDatabaseWorkSession()`, `toDatabaseWorkSession()`
- ‚úÖ Some components use UnifiedWorkSession in tests
- ‚úÖ Database schema supports unified model

#### What's STILL INCOMPLETE:
11 separate WorkSession interfaces still exist and are actively used:

```
LocalWorkSession (useTaskStore.ts)              ‚ùå Still imported/used
WorkSession (workflow-progress-types.ts)        ‚ùå Still imported/used  
WorkSession (work-blocks-types.ts)              ‚ùå Still imported/used
WorkSession (WorkLoggerCalendar.tsx)            ‚ùå Still imported/used
WorkSession (WorkSessionsModal.tsx)             ‚ùå Still imported/used
... and 6 more across the codebase
```

#### Migration Status by File:
```
useTaskStore.ts                 ‚ùå Still uses LocalWorkSession
WorkLoggerCalendar.tsx         ‚ùå Still uses local WorkSession interface
WorkSessionsModal.tsx          ‚ùå Still uses local WorkSession interface
StepWorkSessionsModal.tsx      ‚ùå Still uses local WorkSession interface
workflow-progress-types.ts     ‚ùå Still defines separate WorkSession
work-blocks-types.ts           ‚ùå Still defines separate WorkSession
```

#### Why It Failed:
1. Each component had custom fields in their WorkSession types
2. Database operations not fully abstracted
3. UI components never updated to use adapters
4. Type checking errors when attempting migration

#### To Complete:
1. Update all UI components to import UnifiedWorkSession
2. Remove duplicate WorkSession interface definitions
3. Update database operations to use unified adapters
4. Fix type checking errors
5. Test all time logging functionality

### 3. Voice Amendment System (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)

**Status**: ‚ùå INCOMPLETE  
**Progress**: ~70% done  
**Started**: August 2025  
**Last Attempt**: September 2025

#### What EXISTS:
- ‚úÖ Voice recording and transcription working
- ‚úÖ Claude AI parsing working for most amendment types
- ‚úÖ Amendment display in UI working
- ‚úÖ Basic amendment application working
- ‚úÖ IPC serialization handling working

#### What's STILL INCOMPLETE:
- ‚ùå Step removal operations incomplete (workflow dependencies broken)
- ‚ùå Dependency editing through amendments has issues
- ‚ùå ENTIRE test suite skipped: `voice-amendment-integration.test.tsx`
- ‚ùå Complex multi-step amendment flows not working
- ‚ùå Error handling for malformed amendments incomplete

#### Test Status:
```
describe.skip('Voice Amendment Integration')  // ENTIRE SUITE DISABLED
```

#### Why It Failed:
1. Complex dependency relationships when removing workflow steps
2. Database transaction handling for multi-step amendments
3. Test suite too complex to maintain
4. Edge case error handling never completed

#### To Complete:
1. Fix step removal with proper dependency cleanup
2. Fix dependency editing operations
3. Enable and fix integration test suite
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Test complex amendment scenarios

### 4. Database Unified Task Model (MOSTLY COMPLETE, EDGE CASES INCOMPLETE)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MOSTLY COMPLETE WITH GAPS  
**Progress**: ~85% done  
**Started**: August 2025  
**Last Attempt**: August 2025

#### What EXISTS:
- ‚úÖ Database schema unified (Tasks can have steps)
- ‚úÖ Basic CRUD operations working
- ‚úÖ UI displays unified tasks correctly
- ‚úÖ Most workflow operations working

#### What's STILL INCOMPLETE:
- ‚ùå 2 skipped tests in `database-unified.test.ts`:
  - `'should create a workflow task with steps - Task type does not support steps'`
  - `'should handle legacy sequenced task methods - complex mock setup'`
- ‚ùå Legacy sequenced task methods compatibility incomplete
- ‚ùå Some workflow creation edge cases broken

#### Test Status:
```
it.skip('should create a workflow task with steps - Task type does not support steps')
it.skip('should handle legacy sequenced task methods - complex mock setup')
```

#### Why It Failed:
1. Complex test setup for legacy compatibility
2. Edge cases in workflow creation
3. Type system conflicts between old/new models

#### To Complete:
1. Fix or delete skipped database tests
2. Ensure all workflow creation paths work
3. Test legacy compatibility thoroughly
4. Remove old sequenced task code if not needed

## üîÑ ABANDONED FEATURE IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. NLP Pattern Matching for Voice Amendments (ABANDONED)

**Status**: ‚ùå ABANDONED (Should be deleted)  
**Started**: July 2025  
**Abandoned**: August 2025

#### What EXISTS (Should be deleted):
- ‚ùå 8 skipped tests in `amendment-parser.test.ts` for NLP patterns
- ‚ùå Pattern matching code that's never used
- ‚ùå Fuzzy matching logic that was replaced by Claude AI

#### Why Abandoned:
Claude AI parsing proved more effective than manual NLP patterns.

#### Action Required:
DELETE all skipped NLP pattern tests and related code.

---

### 2. Complex Workflow Step Scheduling (ATTEMPTED, INCOMPLETE)

**Status**: ‚ùå INCOMPLETE  
**Progress**: ~20% done

#### What's INCOMPLETE:
- ‚ùå Skipped test: `'should handle chained async dependencies (needs workflow step scheduling fix)'`
- ‚ùå Complex async dependency chains not working
- ‚ùå Workflow step inheritance issues

#### Test Status:
```
it.skip('should handle chained async dependencies (needs workflow step scheduling fix)')
```

#### To Complete:
1. Fix chained async dependency handling
2. Fix workflow step scheduling bugs
3. Enable and fix related tests

## üîß QUALITY ISSUES

### 1. Console.log Usage in Scripts (UNDOCUMENTED TECHNICAL DEBT)

**Status**: ‚ùå INCOMPLETE  
**Files Affected**: 50+ script files

#### Issue:
Scripts directory contains hundreds of console.log statements without eslint-disable comments.

#### Files with console.log (Partial list):
```
scripts/pr/pr-comment-reply.ts
scripts/analysis/check-error-logs.ts
scripts/dev/time-export.ts
... 47+ more files
```

#### Action Required:
1. Add `// eslint-disable-next-line no-console` to each usage
2. OR replace with proper logging where applicable
3. Document why console.log is acceptable in scripts

### 2. Multiple Logger Implementations (UNDOCUMENTED)

**Status**: ‚ùå UNDOCUMENTED  

#### Issue:
Multiple logger implementations exist with no documentation about which to use:

```
src/renderer/utils/logger.ts          (UI logger)
src/main/utils/logger.ts               (Main process logger)  
src/shared/utils/logger.ts             (Shared logger)
logging/formatters/                    (Specialized formatters)
```

#### Action Required:
1. Document which logger to use in which context
2. Create migration plan to consolidate if needed
3. Add usage guidelines to CLAUDE.md
