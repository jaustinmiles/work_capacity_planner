# Cognitive Load Management for Developers

## The PR #76 Cognitive Collapse

During PR #76, cognitive overload caused:
- Same bugs fixed multiple times
- False claims of completion
- Type safety abandoned for `any`
- Missing obvious errors
- Communication breakdown

This document provides strategies to prevent cognitive overload.

## Understanding Cognitive Load

### The Three Types

1. **Intrinsic Load** (Essential Complexity)
   - Understanding the business domain
   - Learning the codebase structure
   - Grasping architectural patterns
   - ‚úÖ Cannot be reduced, must be managed

2. **Extraneous Load** (Accidental Complexity)
   - Poor documentation
   - Inconsistent patterns
   - Bad tooling
   - ‚ùå Can and should be eliminated

3. **Germane Load** (Learning Investment)
   - Building mental models
   - Creating abstractions
   - Pattern recognition
   - ‚úÖ Beneficial, should be optimized

## The Cognitive Budget Model

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  Your Daily Cognitive Budget: 100 units       ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

Typical Costs:
- Understanding new code: 10-20 units
- Debugging complex issue: 20-30 units
- Context switch: 5-10 units
- Fighting tools/types: 15-20 units
- Code review response: 15-25 units

When budget depleted:
- Error rate increases 3x
- "Quick fixes" become disasters
- Communication breaks down
- Type safety abandoned
```

## Context Switching Penalty

### The 15-Minute Rule
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ Deep Focus  ‚îÇ  0-15 min: Building context
‚îÇ    Zone     ‚îÇ  15-45 min: Peak productivity
‚îÇ             ‚îÇ  45+ min: Diminishing returns
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
       ‚Üì

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  Lost Time  ‚îÇ  15 min: Context recovery
‚îÇ             ‚îÇ  + Previous progress forgotten
‚îÇ             ‚îÇ  + Mental model rebuilding
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### File Switching Costs
```python
# Cognitive cost formula
cost = base_cost + (files_open * complexity_factor) + (switches * switch_penalty)

where:
  base_cost = 10
  complexity_factor = 2
  switch_penalty = 5

# Example: 20 files, 10 switches
cost = 10 + (20 * 2) + (10 * 5) = 100 units (budget exhausted!)
```

## Strategies for Managing Load

### 1. The Chunking Strategy

**Break large changes into cognitive chunks:**

```
Large PR (40 files) ‚Üí Cognitive Overload ‚ùå

          ‚Üì Break Down

Chunk 1: Type definitions (5 files)
Chunk 2: Core logic update (8 files)
Chunk 3: UI updates (7 files)
Chunk 4: Test updates (10 files)

= Manageable Cognitive Load ‚úÖ
```

### 2. The Systematic Pattern

**Don't jump between instances, fix systematically:**

```bash
# WRONG: High cognitive load
Fix file A line 10 ‚Üí Fix file B line 20 ‚Üí Back to file A line 50...

# RIGHT: Low cognitive load
Find all instances ‚Üí Group by pattern ‚Üí Fix all in file A ‚Üí Move to file B
```

### 3. The Documentation-First Approach

**Offload memory to documentation:**

```markdown
## Current State
- Working on: Capacity field unification
- Files touched: [List]
- Patterns found: [List]
- Decisions made: [List]
- Next steps: [List]
```

This becomes your external brain, reducing working memory load.

### 4. The Verification Checkpoint

**Regular verification reduces anxiety load:**

```bash
# Every 3 files
npm run typecheck  # Verify no type errors

# Every 5 files  
npm run lint       # Verify code quality

# Every 10 files
npm test -- --run  # Verify nothing broken
```

Knowing things work reduces background anxiety.

### 5. The Type-First Method

**Define types before implementation:**

```typescript
// FIRST: Define the shape (low cognitive load)
interface TaskScheduleData {
  taskId: string
  workBlockId: string
  startTime: Date
  duration: number
  capacity: BlockCapacity
}

// THEN: Implement (types guide you)
function scheduleTask(data: TaskScheduleData) {
  // TypeScript helps reduce cognitive load here
}
```

## Warning Signs of Overload

### Early Warning (50-70% capacity)
- üü° Starting to forget why you made changes
- üü° Tempted to skip tests "just this once"
- üü° Copy-pasting without understanding

### Danger Zone (70-90% capacity)
- üü† Reaching for `any` type
- üü† Making the same fix twice
- üü† Can't explain what you're doing
- üü† Skipping verification steps

### Critical Overload (90-100% capacity)
- üî¥ Using `@ts-ignore`
- üî¥ "It works on my machine"
- üî¥ Can't remember the original goal
- üî¥ Communication breakdown
- üî¥ Angry at the code/tools

### Recovery Required (>100% capacity)
- ‚ò†Ô∏è Making things worse with each "fix"
- ‚ò†Ô∏è Complete context loss
- ‚ò†Ô∏è Unable to understand own code
- ‚ò†Ô∏è PR becomes unsalvageable

## Recovery Strategies

### The Step-Back Protocol

When you recognize overload:

1. **STOP** (Don't dig deeper)
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "WIP: Stepping back to reduce cognitive load"
   ```

2. **DOCUMENT** (Offload from working memory)
   ```markdown
   ## Brain Dump
   - What I was trying to do: ...
   - What went wrong: ...
   - What I've tried: ...
   - What I'm confused about: ...
   ```

3. **SIMPLIFY** (Reduce scope)
   - Pick ONE thing to fix
   - Fix it completely
   - Verify it works
   - Then move to next

4. **VERIFY** (Rebuild confidence)
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   npm test -- --run
   ```

5. **FRESH START** (If needed)
   ```bash
   # Sometimes starting over is faster
   git checkout -b feature-name-fresh main
   # Apply lessons learned
   ```

## Cognitive Load Optimization Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Scout Rule
"Leave code better than you found it, but not perfect"

```typescript
// Found this:
function calc(x: any, y: any): any { ... }

// Improvement (manageable):
function calculate(amount: number, rate: number): number { ... }

// NOT this (scope creep):
// Refactoring entire calculation system...
```

### Pattern 2: The Breadcrumb Trail
"Document your path for your future self"

```typescript
// TODO(2024-01-15): Temporary workaround for capacity issue
// Real fix requires updating scheduler (see TECH_DEBT.md#scheduler)
// Current approach: Using default capacity when not specified
const capacity = workBlock.capacity ?? DEFAULT_CAPACITY
```

### Pattern 3: The Incremental Migration
"Change gradually, verify constantly"

```bash
# Instead of: Update all 40 files at once
# Do this:
Update 5 files ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí
Update 5 files ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí
... repeat
```

## Tools for Cognitive Support

### 1. External Memory Tools
- **PR Template**: Track what you're doing
- **Todo List**: Offload task tracking
- **Git Commits**: Document incremental progress
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic

### 2. Verification Tools
- **TypeScript**: Catches errors you'd miss
- **ESLint**: Enforces patterns
- **Tests**: Verify behavior
- **Scripts**: Automate repetitive checks

### 3. Exploration Tools
- **grep/ripgrep**: Find all instances
- **VSCode Search**: Visual pattern finding
- **Git blame**: Understand history
- **Documentation**: Reduce memory load

## The Cognitive Load Checklist

### Before Starting Work
- [ ] Am I well-rested? (Tired = 50% capacity)
- [ ] Do I understand the goal?
- [ ] Have I documented the plan?
- [ ] Is the scope manageable? (<20 files)
- [ ] Do I have uninterrupted time?

### During Work
- [ ] Am I making incremental progress?
- [ ] Am I verifying changes regularly?
- [ ] Am I documenting decisions?
- [ ] Am I tempted by shortcuts? (Warning sign!)
- [ ] Can I explain what I'm doing?

### When Struggling
- [ ] Have I been working >2 hours straight?
- [ ] Am I trying to hold too much in memory?
- [ ] Should I document and take a break?
- [ ] Am I making the same mistakes?
- [ ] Should I ask for help?

### After Work Session
- [ ] Document current state
- [ ] Commit work in progress
- [ ] Note any confusion/blockers
- [ ] Plan next session's starting point

## The Science Behind It

### Miller's Law: 7¬±2
Working memory holds 5-9 items. Each file/concept uses slots:
- 3 files = comfortable
- 7 files = at capacity  
- 10+ files = overload, errors increase

### Cognitive Load Theory
- **Split Attention Effect**: Jumping between files hurts comprehension
- **Expertise Reversal**: Experts need different strategies than beginners
- **Worked Example Effect**: Following patterns reduces load

### Flow State Requirements
1. Clear goals
2. Immediate feedback
3. Balance of challenge/skill
4. No interruptions
5. Sense of control

## Personal Cognitive Management

### Know Your Peak Hours
```
Morning Person:         Night Owl:
6am  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Low           6am  ‚ñà Very Low
9am  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Peak        9am  ‚ñà‚ñà Low
12pm ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Good         12pm ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Medium
3pm  ‚ñà‚ñà Low            3pm  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Good
6pm  ‚ñà Very Low        6pm  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Peak
9pm  ‚ñà Exhausted       9pm  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Good

Schedule complex work during peak hours!
```

### Your Cognitive Profile

Track and learn:
- How many files can you handle?
- How long before fatigue?
- What increases your load most?
- What recovery methods work?
- When are your peak hours?

## Recovery Activities

### Quick Recovery (5 minutes)
- Walk around
- Drink water
- Look out window
- Deep breathing
- Stretch

### Medium Recovery (15 minutes)
- Short walk outside
- Coffee/tea break
- Chat with someone
- Listen to music
- Meditate

### Full Recovery (30+ minutes)
- Exercise
- Nap
- Meal break
- Complete context switch
- Hobby activity

## The Ultimate Rule

> **When cognitive load exceeds 80%, STOP.**
> 
> Every decision made under overload creates technical debt.
> Every shortcut taken will require 10x effort to fix later.
> Every `any` type will haunt you in review.
>
> It's not about working harder; it's about working within your cognitive capacity.
