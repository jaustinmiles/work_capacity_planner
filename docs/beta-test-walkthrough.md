# Beta Test Walkthrough

This document outlines the comprehensive user journey for testing the Work Capacity Planner application.

## Test Scenario: Complete Workflow from Schedule to Task Execution

### Phase 1: Schedule Setup
1. **Multi-Day Voice Schedule Recording**
   - Start voice recording for schedule
   - Describe today's schedule AND tomorrow's schedule in one recording
   - Example: "Today I'm working 9-5 with a meeting at 2pm. Tomorrow I have a doctor's appointment at 10am and will work from noon to 6pm"
   - **Verify**: Both days should be populated from single voice memo
   - **Verify**: Sleep blocks should be auto-generated from voice input
   
2. **Schedule Review & Edit**
   - Review the generated schedules for multiple days
   - Navigate between days to verify all were created
   - Make any necessary edits to time blocks
   - Add missing blocks (e.g., sleep if not auto-generated)
   - Test "Clear Schedule" functionality

### Phase 2: Context & Task Creation
3. **Job Context Setup**
   - Open AI brainstorm modal
   - Record job context via voice
   - **Future Feature**: Separate permanent vs day-to-day context
   
4. **Jargon Dictionary**
   - Review auto-populated technical terms (via AI extraction)
   - Fill in definitions for identified jargon
   - Add any missing terms manually
   
5. **Task Brainstorming**
   - Record all todos and tasks on your mind
   - Use voice input for natural task description
   
6. **AI Task Review**
   - Review AI-generated tasks and workflows
   - Check for accuracy and completeness
   - **Future Feature**: Answer AI questions in dialogue box for task refinement

### Phase 3: Task Management
7. **Task Approval**
   - Approve and create the generated tasks
   - Verify tasks are saved to database
   
8. **Workflow Management**
   - Navigate to workflow view
   - Click through each workflow
   
9. **Workflow Refinement** (for each workflow)
   - View dependency graph
   - Make dependency edits as needed
   - Add missing tasks
   - Adjust time estimates
   
10. **Schedule Optimization**
    - View Gantt chart
    - Make priority adjustments
    - **Future Feature**: Adjust priority directly from Gantt chart
    - **Future Feature**: Click tasks to navigate to edit view

### Phase 4: Execution & Tracking
11. **Work Simulation**
    - Mark some tasks as completed
    - Log time for completed work
    - Update task progress
    
12. **Dynamic Scheduling**
    - Add new tasks
    - Observe how they interleave with existing tasks
    - Verify smart scheduling algorithm
    
13. **Views Verification**
    - Check Calendar view for scheduled tasks
    - Review task queue for priority order
    
14. **Voice Features** (Future)
    - Test voice input for work logging
    - Try voice commands for workflow modifications

## Known Issues & Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues (2025-08-13)
- Task creation bug (missing updatedAt field)
- Message import error in BrainstormModal  
- Database protection verified (backups exist)
- React Flow graph edges rendering immediately
- Personal tasks feature added (work/personal categories)
- Clear Schedule functionality fixed
- **0 duration bug** - Workflows now save with correct durations (totalDuration field)
- **WebM upload** - Fixed with proper OpenAI API file handling
- **Jargon dictionary input** - Added editable fields for definitions
- **Graph visualization** - Fixed canvas blank issue when editing
- **Sleep block extraction** - AI now auto-detects sleep times from voice
- **Time picker UI** - New visual clock interface for intuitive time selection

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues
- Multi-day scheduling from single voice memo needs testing

### üöÄ Upcoming Features
- Personal life tasks (separate from work tasks)
- Permanent vs temporary job context
- Interactive Q&A for task clarification
- Gantt chart priority editing
- Voice-based work logging
