# User Stories and UI Flow

This document describes the user experience, workflows, and interaction patterns of the Work Capacity Planner application.

## Target User

**Primary User**: Software engineers and technical professionals who need to manage complex workloads with realistic time constraints and capacity planning.

**User Needs**:
- Manage both simple tasks and complex multi-step workflows
- Understand realistic time allocation based on available capacity
- Visualize work distribution across time
- Prioritize tasks using proven methodologies (Eisenhower Matrix)
- Persist work data between sessions

## Core User Stories

### Story 1: Basic Task Management
**As a software engineer**, I want to create and manage individual tasks so that I can track my work items and priorities.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ I can create tasks with name, duration, importance (1-5), urgency (1-5), and type (focused/admin)
- ✅ I can edit task details inline by clicking on task names
- ✅ I can mark tasks as complete and see completion status
- ✅ I can delete tasks I no longer need
- ✅ Tasks persist between application restarts

**UI Flow**:
1. User clicks "Add Task" button in Task List view
2. Modal form opens with task creation fields
3. User fills in required information and submits
4. Task appears in the list immediately
5. User can inline-edit by clicking on task name
6. User can toggle completion with checkbox
7. User can delete with trash icon

### Story 2: Complex Workflow Creation
**As a project manager**, I want to create multi-step workflows so that I can break down complex projects into manageable steps with dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ I can create "Sequenced Tasks" with multiple steps
- ✅ Each step can have its own duration, type, and dependencies
- ✅ I can see the critical path and total duration calculations
- ✅ I can track progress through individual workflow steps
- ✅ Workflows persist and can be resumed between sessions

**UI Flow**:
1. User clicks "Add Workflow" button
2. Workflow creation form opens with:
   - Overall workflow name and metadata
   - Step-by-step builder interface
   - Dependency configuration options
3. User adds multiple steps with individual durations
4. System calculates critical path and total time
5. User submits and workflow appears in sequenced tasks list
6. User can expand workflow to see individual steps
7. User can track progress through each step

### Story 3: Smart Work Scheduling
**As a busy professional**, I want the system to automatically distribute my tasks across available time so that I can see a realistic schedule.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ System considers my daily capacity limits (4h focused, 3h admin)
- ✅ Tasks are scheduled based on priority (importance × urgency)
- ✅ Dependencies are respected in scheduling
- ✅ I can see a visual timeline of when work should happen
- ✅ System handles partial task allocation across multiple days

**UI Flow**:
1. User has created various tasks and workflows
2. User clicks "Generate Schedule" button
3. System runs scheduling algorithm considering:
   - Available daily capacity
   - Task priorities and dependencies
   - Task types (focused vs admin work)
4. Timeline view shows visual schedule with:
   - Color-coded task blocks
   - Daily capacity indicators
   - Multi-day task spanning
5. User can see schedule statistics and optimization suggestions

### Story 4: Priority Visualization
**As a decision maker**, I want to visualize task priorities using the Eisenhower Matrix so that I can focus on what matters most.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Tasks are automatically plotted based on importance/urgency scores
- ✅ I can see four quadrants: Do First, Schedule, Delegate, Don't Do
- ✅ I can take action on tasks directly from the matrix view
- ✅ Visual indicators show workload distribution across quadrants

**UI Flow**:
1. User navigates to "Eisenhower Matrix" tab
2. System automatically plots all tasks based on their scores
3. Matrix shows four quadrants with clear labels
4. Tasks appear as cards in appropriate quadrants
5. User can interact with tasks directly in matrix view
6. User gains insight into priority distribution

## Key UX Principles

### 1. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Simple tasks are easy to create (minimal form)
- Complex workflows reveal advanced options progressively
- Scheduling happens automatically but can be customized

### 2. **Immediate Feedback**
- Tasks appear instantly after creation
- Inline editing provides immediate updates
- Visual feedback for all user actions
- Error handling with clear messages

### 3. **Data Persistence**
- All data survives application restarts
- No work is ever lost unexpectedly
- Automatic saving without user intervention

### 4. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Important tasks are visually prominent
- Color coding for task types and priorities
- Clear typography and spacing
- Professional desktop application aesthetic

### 5. **Flexible Workflow**
- Multiple ways to view and organize work
- Non-linear navigation between views
- User can work in their preferred style

## Current State vs Future Enhancements

### Currently Implemented ✅
- Complete task and workflow CRUD operations
- Database persistence with SQLite
- Smart scheduling algorithm
- Multiple view modes (List, Matrix, Calendar, Timeline)
- Professional UI with Arco Design components
- Real-time capacity calculations

### Future Enhancements 🚀
- **Workflow Execution**: Start/pause/reset workflow functionality (marked as TODO)
- **Timeline Interaction**: Click handlers for timeline items (marked as TODO)
- **Work Day Configuration**: Custom daily schedules and meeting management
- **Advanced Analytics**: Burndown charts, productivity metrics
- **Calendar Integration**: External calendar sync
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared workspaces and task assignment

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Flow
```
User Action → UI Component → Zustand Store → IPC → Main Process → Database → Response Chain
```

### State Management
- **Zustand Store**: Manages all application state
- **Database Service**: Handles persistence via IPC
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error states across all operations
- **Loading States**: User feedback during async operations

### Security Model
- **Process Isolation**: Main and renderer processes are properly separated
- **Context Bridge**: Secure IPC communication via preload script
- **No Direct Database Access**: Renderer process uses IPC only

This documentation captures the current user experience and provides a roadmap for future enhancements while maintaining the core philosophy of intelligent, capacity-based work planning.
