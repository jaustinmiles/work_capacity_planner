## ‚úÖ Recently Fixed - Workflow Dependency Resolution (2025-08-20)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
- Issue: Completed workflow steps were filtered out, causing dependent steps to fail with "Missing dependency"
- Solution: Track completed steps separately for dependency resolution
- Impact: All workflow steps with completed dependencies can now be scheduled

## ‚úÖ Recently Resolved - Major Scheduling Fixes (2025-08-29, PR #31)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and Merged to Main

### Unified Scheduling Logic
- Created `scheduling-common.ts` with shared utilities
- Eliminated duplicate topological sort implementations  
- Unified critical path calculation
- Consolidated dependency checking logic
- Fixed async workflow scheduling to respect wait times
- Both optimal and flexible schedulers now use common utilities

### Removed Hardcoded Weekend Assumptions
- No more automatic weekend personal blocks (10am-4pm removed)
- No special treatment for weekends vs weekdays
- Scheduler respects user-defined work patterns ONLY
- Default work hours apply to ALL days equally
- Personal blocks created ONLY when personal tasks exist

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Midnight boundary bug**: Blocks no longer cross 23:59
- **Stack overflow**: Fixed self-reference in topological sort
- **CI test failures**: Fixed Date object comparison issues
- **Block types**: All 'mixed' changed to 'flexible' for optimization

## ‚úÖ Recently Fixed (2025-08-29, PR #33)

### Critical Schedule Generation Bugs - FIXED
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed in PR #33
- **Sleep blocks deleted during generation**: Now preserves existing meetings/blocks
- **Flexible blocks broken on day 1**: All blocks use 'flexible' type consistently
- **Sleep blocks cut off at midnight in UI**: Fixed type checking for proper rendering
- **Added comprehensive logging**: Better visibility into schedule generation

## üî¥ CRITICAL Issues (2025-08-29)

### 1. Amendment Applicator Limited to 40% Coverage - CRITICAL
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Voice amendments fail for most common operations

**Analysis Completed (2025-08-30):**
- Only ~40% of task/workflow attributes can be modified via voice
- Critical missing: deadline management (user's "bedtime to 11pm" failed)
- See /docs/amendment-applicator-analysis.md for full analysis

**Missing Critical Features:**
- **No deadline management** - Cannot set/change deadlines or deadline types
- **No priority updates** - Cannot change importance/urgency after creation  
- **No cognitive complexity** - Cannot set mental load ratings (1-5)
- **No task type changes** - Cannot switch between focused/admin/personal
- **Step removal not implemented** - Type exists but logic missing
- **Incomplete step operations** - Duration, notes, time logging TODO

**Required Amendment Types to Implement:**
1. DeadlineChange - For setting/changing deadlines
2. PriorityChange - For importance/urgency/complexity
3. TypeChange - For task/step type modifications
4. Complete StepRemoval implementation
5. Step-level duration/notes/time logging

**Priority**: HIGHEST - Users cannot use voice for basic edits

## Known Issues (Updated 2025-08-29)

### 2. Work Pattern Repetition Not Implemented
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Impact**: User has to manually copy sleep schedules to each day

**Problem:**
- UI shows "daily" repetition option for work blocks
- Backend doesn't actually implement repetition
- Each pattern is saved only for the specific date
- No logic to apply patterns to future dates

**Solution Needed:**
- Implement repetition logic in database layer
- Add recurring pattern support (daily, weekly, etc.)
- Update UI to properly reflect repetition status

## Architectural Issues (Updated - 2025-08-29)

### 1. ESLint Configuration Too Permissive (NEW - 2025-08-29)
**Severity**: üü° Medium (but causes üî¥ Critical bugs)
**Impact**: Missing null/undefined checks cause runtime errors

**Problems:**
- Current ESLint config doesn't catch potentially undefined values
- No strict null checking rules enabled  
- TypeScript `@typescript-eslint/recommended` preset too lenient
- Leads to bugs like `sortedItems[0]` access without safety checks
- Manual checking error-prone and inconsistent

**Examples Found:**
- `sortedItems[0].startTime` accessed without verifying array has elements
- Many places where optional chaining should be required but isn't

**Solution Needed:**
- Enable `@typescript-eslint/strict-boolean-expressions`
- Enable `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access`
- Fix all resulting errors (likely 100+ locations)
- Consider gradual migration with file-by-file enforcement

### 2. Workflow/Task Model Confusion
**Severity**: üî¥ Critical  
**Impact**: Constant type confusion, bugs, and workarounds

**Problems:**
- Workflows stored as Tasks with `hasSteps=true` causing type confusion
- Priority calculation creates fake Task objects from TaskSteps  
- Duplicate logic for handling tasks vs workflow steps
- Constant type casting throughout codebase

**Proposed Fix:** See context/architecture-improvements.md

### 2. Configuration Propagation Complexity
**Severity**: üü† High  
**Impact**: Difficult to maintain, excessive prop drilling

**Problems:**
- Multiple config objects (SchedulingPreferences, WorkSettings, etc.)
- Each component needs to thread configs through
- Hard to add new configuration options

**Proposed Fix:** Unified scheduling context/store

### 3. Multiple Scheduler Implementations
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Impact**: Maintenance burden, potential inconsistencies

**Current State (Partially Fixed):**
- ‚úÖ Created scheduling-common.ts with shared logic
- ‚úÖ Unified topological sort and dependency checking
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still have 3 separate schedulers:
  - optimal-scheduler.ts (for optimization mode)
  - flexible-scheduler.ts (for manual mode)  
  - deadline-scheduler.ts (for balanced/async modes)

**Proposed Next Step:** Merge into single scheduler with modes/strategies

## Remaining High Priority Issues

### 1. Scheduling Test Suite Rewrite Needed (2025-08-17)
**Severity**: üü† High  
**Impact**: Tests skipped to allow deployment, but need proper coverage

**Status:**
- ‚úÖ Consolidated scheduling engines (deadline pressure and async urgency now in SchedulingEngine)
- ‚úÖ Removed unused scheduler.ts
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Skipped failing tests in deadline-scheduling.test.ts (entire suite)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Skipped 1 test in dependency-scheduling.test.ts

**Tests needing rewrite:**
- `deadline-scheduling.test.ts` - Tests the old deadline-scheduler which works differently than unified SchedulingEngine
- `dependency-scheduling.test.ts` - "should handle multiple independent workflows" test expects different scheduling behavior

**Action needed:**
- Write new test suite for the unified SchedulingEngine
- Test deadline pressure calculations in context of SchedulingEngine
- Test async urgency calculations in context of SchedulingEngine
- Test priority calculation with all factors combined

### 2. AI Amendment Dependency Editing (2025-08-17) 
**Severity**: üü† High
**Impact**: Voice amendments for dependencies not working

**Issue discovered during beta test**
- Dependency changes via voice commands fail
- Need to debug amendment-applicator.ts dependency logic

### 3. Workflow Step Operations
**Severity**: üü† High  
**Impact**: Limited workflow editing capabilities

**Partially Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ Step addition via voice amendments
- ‚úÖ Step status updates implemented (2025-08-28)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Step time logging not yet implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Step notes not yet implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Step removal not yet implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency changes not yet implemented

**Implementation Path**:
```typescript
// These TODOs exist in amendment-applicator.ts
case AmendmentType.StepRemoval:
  // TODO: Implement step removal
case AmendmentType.DependencyChange:
  // TODO: Implement dependency changes
```

### 2. Task/Workflow Creation via Voice
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Impact**: Can't create new items via voice

**Status**: Not implemented
- Amendment types defined but not implemented
- Would allow "Create a new task for code review"
- Would allow "Create a workflow for deployment"

### 5. Workflow UI Polish
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Impact**: UX improvements needed

**Issues**:
- Graph view could be more interactive
- Step completion UI needs better feedback
- Dependency visualization could be clearer

## Low Priority Issues

### 6. Documentation Updates
**Severity**: üîµ Low  
**Impact**: Developer onboarding

**Needs Update**:
- Architecture diagram (still shows old dual model)
